# iMLBench
iMLBench is a machine learning benchmark suite targeting  CPU-GPU integrated architectures.

## Programs
Currently, we provide machine learning workloads including Linear Regression (LR), K-means (KM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Back Propagation (BP), 2D Convolution Neural Network (2DCNN), 3D Convolution Neural Network (3DCNN), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and Winograd Convolution (Winograd).

## Implementation
We provide OpenMP and OpenCL implementations for CPU-only, GPU-only, CPU-GPU co-running common machine learning applications.
