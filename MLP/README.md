## Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)

Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is a typical class of feed-forward artificial neural network, comprising of an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer. Since the neurons within MLP use nonlinear activation functions, MLP can deal with nonlinear data. MLP is often used to get approximate solutions for complicated problems and to create regression models and classifications. Our implementation is based on ClNET [“clNET: OpenCL for Nets,” https://github.com/ mz24cn/clnet, 2018].
