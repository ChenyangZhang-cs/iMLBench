Call to Renewal Keynote Address Call to Renewal Pt 1Call to Renewal Part 2 TOPIC: Our Past, Our Future & Vision for America June 
28, 2006 Call to Renewal' Keynote Address Complete Text Good morning. I appreciate the opportunity to speak here at the Call to R
enewal's Building a Covenant for a New America conference. I've had the opportunity to take a look at your Covenant for a New Ame
rica. It is filled with outstanding policies and prescriptions for much of what ails this country. So I'd like to congratulate yo
u all on the thoughtful presentations you've given so far about poverty and justice in America, and for putting fire under the fe
et of the political leadership here in Washington.But today I'd like to talk about the connection between religion and politics a
nd perhaps offer some thoughts about how we can sort through some of the often bitter arguments that we've been seeing over the l
ast several years.I do so because, as you all know, we can affirm the importance of poverty in the Bible; and we can raise up and
 pass out this Covenant for a New America. We can talk to the press, and we can discuss the religious call to address poverty and
 environmental stewardship all we want, but it won't have an impact unless we tackle head-on the mutual suspicion that sometimes 
exists between religious America and secular America.I want to give you an example that I think illustrates this fact. As some of
 you know, during the 2004 U.S. Senate General Election I ran against a gentleman named Alan Keyes. Mr. Keyes is well-versed in t
he Jerry Falwell-Pat Robertson style of rhetoric that often labels progressives as both immoral and godless.Indeed, Mr. Keyes ann
ounced towards the end of the campaign that, "Jesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama. Christ would not vote for Barack Obam
a because Barack Obama has behaved in a way that it is inconceivable for Christ to have behaved."Jesus Christ would not vote for 
Barack Obama.Now, I was urged by some of my liberal supporters not to take this statement seriously, to essentially ignore it. To
 them, Mr. Keyes was an extremist, and his arguments not worth entertaining. And since at the time, I was up 40 points in the pol
ls, it probably wasn't a bad piece of strategic advice.But what they didn't understand, however, was that I had to take Mr. Keyes
 seriously, for he claimed to speak for my religion, and my God. He claimed knowledge of certain truths.Mr. Obama says he's a Chr
istian, he was saying, and yet he supports a lifestyle that the Bible calls an abomination.Mr. Obama says he's a Christian, but s
upports the destruction of innocent and sacred life.And so what would my supporters have me say? How should I respond? Should I s
ay that a literalist reading of the Bible was folly? Should I say that Mr. Keyes, who is a Roman Catholic, should ignore the teac
hings of the Pope?Unwilling to go there, I answered with what has come to be the typically liberal response in such debates - nam
ely, I said that we live in a pluralistic society, that I can't impose my own religious views on another, that I was running to b
e the U.S. Senator of Illinois and not the Minister of Illinois.But Mr. Keyes's implicit accusation that I was not a true Christi
an nagged at me, and I was also aware that my answer did not adequately address the role my faith has in guiding my own values an
d my own beliefs.Now, my dilemma was by no means unique. In a way, it reflected the broader debate we've been having in this coun
try for the last thirty years over the role of religion in politics.For some time now, there has been plenty of talk among pundit
s and pollsters that the political divide in this country has fallen sharply along religious lines. Indeed, the single biggest "g
ap" in party affiliation among white Americans today is not between men and women, or those who reside in so-called Red States an
d those who reside in Blue, but between those who attend church regularly and those who don't.Conservative leaders have been all 
too happy to exploit this gap, consistently reminding evangelical Christians that Democrats disrespect their values and dislike t
heir Church, while suggesting to the rest of the country that religious Americans care only about issues like abortion and gay ma
rriage; school prayer and intelligent design.Democrats, for the most part, have taken the bait. At best, we may try to avoid the 
conversation about religious values altogether, fearful of offending anyone and claiming that - regardless of our personal belief
s - constitutional principles tie our hands. At worst, there are some liberals who dismiss religion in the public square as inher
ently irrational or intolerant, insisting on a caricature of religious Americans that paints them as fanatical, or thinking that 
the very word "Christian" describes one's political opponents, not people of faith.Now, such strategies of avoidance may work for
 progressives when our opponent is Alan Keyes. But over the long haul, I think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the 
power of faith in people's lives -- in the lives of the American people -- and I think it's time that we join a serious debate ab
out how to reconcile faith with our modern, pluralistic democracy.And if we're going to do that then we first need to understand 
that Americans are a religious people. 90 percent of us believe in God, 70 percent affiliate themselves with an organized religio
n, 38 percent call themselves committed Christians, and substantially more people in America believe in angels than they do in ev
olution.This religious tendency is not simply the result of successful marketing by skilled preachers or the draw of popular mega
-churches. In fact, it speaks to a hunger that's deeper than that - a hunger that goes beyond any particular issue or cause.Each 
day, it seems, thousands of Americans are going about their daily rounds - dropping off the kids at school, driving to the office
, flying to a business meeting, shopping at the mall, trying to stay on their diets - and they're coming to the realization that 
something is missing. They are deciding that their work, their possessions, their diversions, their sheer busyness, is not enough
.They want a sense of purpose, a narrative arc to their lives. They're looking to relieve a chronic loneliness, a feeling support
ed by a recent study that shows Americans have fewer close friends and confidants than ever before. And so they need an assurance
 that somebody out there cares about them, is listening to them - that they are not just destined to travel down that long highwa
y towards nothingness.And I speak with some experience on this matter. I was not raised in a particularly religious household, as
 undoubtedly many in the audience were. My father, who returned to Kenya when I was just two, was born Muslim but as an adult bec
ame an atheist. My mother, whose parents were non-practicing Baptists and Methodists, was probably one of the most spiritual and 
kindest people I've ever known, but grew up with a healthy skepticism of organized religion herself. As a consequence, so did I.I
t wasn't until after college, when I went to Chicago to work as a community organizer for a group of Christian churches, that I c
onfronted my own spiritual dilemma.I was working with churches, and the Christians who I worked with recognized themselves in me.
 They saw that I knew their Book and that I shared their values and sang their songs. But they sensed that a part of me that rema
ined removed, detached, that I was an observer in their midst.And in time, I came to realize that something was missing as well -
- that without a vessel for my beliefs, without a commitment to a particular community of faith, at some level I would always rem
ain apart, and alone.And if it weren't for the particular attributes of the historically black church, I may have accepted this f
ate. But as the months passed in Chicago, I found myself drawn - not just to work with the church, but to be in the church.For on
e thing, I believed and still believe in the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change, a power mad
e real by some of the leaders here today. Because of its past, the black church understands in an intimate way the Biblical call 
to feed the hungry and cloth the naked and challenge powers and principalities. And in its historical struggles for freedom and t
he rights of man, I was able to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death, but rather as an act
ive, palpable agent in the world. As a source of hope.And perhaps it was out of this intimate knowledge of hardship -- the ground
ing of faith in struggle -- that the church offered me a second insight, one that I think is important to emphasize today.Faith d
oesn't mean that you don't have doubts.You need to come to church in the first place precisely because you are first of this worl
d, not apart from it. You need to embrace Christ precisely because you have sins to wash away - because you are human and need an
 ally in this difficult journey.It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of
 Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith. It came about 
as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn't fall out in church. The questions I had didn't magically disappear. But kneeling benea
th that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated mys
elf to discovering His truth.That's a path that has been shared by millions upon millions of Americans - evangelicals, Catholics,
 Protestants, Jews and Muslims alike; some since birth, others at certain turning points in their lives. It is not something they
 set apart from the rest of their beliefs and values. In fact, it is often what drives their beliefs and their values.And that is
 why that, if we truly hope to speak to people where they're at - to communicate our hopes and values in a way that's relevant to
 their own - then as progressives, we cannot abandon the field of religious discourse.Because when we ignore the debate about wha
t it means to be a good Christian or Muslim or Jew; when we discuss religion only in the negative sense of where or how it should
 not be practiced, rather than in the positive sense of what it tells us about our obligations towards one another; when we shy a
way from religious venues and religious broadcasts because we assume that we will be unwelcome - others will fill the vacuum, tho
se with the most insular views of faith, or those who cynically use religion to justify partisan ends.In other words, if we don't
 reach out to evangelical Christians and other religious Americans and tell them what we stand for, then the Jerry Falwells and P
at Robertsons and Alan Keyeses will continue to hold sway.More fundamentally, the discomfort of some progressives with any hint o
f religion has often prevented us from effectively addressing issues in moral terms. Some of the problem here is rhetorical - if 
we scrub language of all religious content, we forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of Americans understand
 both their personal morality and social justice.Imagine Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address without reference to "the judgments o
f the Lord." Or King's I Have a Dream speech without references to "all of God's children." Their summoning of a higher truth hel
ped inspire what had seemed impossible, and move the nation to embrace a common destiny.Our failure as progressives to tap into t
he moral underpinnings of the nation is not just rhetorical, though. Our fear of getting "preachy" may also lead us to discount t
he role that values and culture play in some of our most urgent social problems.After all, the problems of poverty and racism, th
e uninsured and the unemployed, are not simply technical problems in search of the perfect ten point plan. They are rooted in bot
h societal indifference and individual callousness - in the imperfections of man.Solving these problems will require changes in g
overnment policy, but it will also require changes in hearts and a change in minds. I believe in keeping guns out of our inner ci
ties, and that our leaders must say so in the face of the gun manufacturers' lobby - but I also believe that when a gang-banger s
hoots indiscriminately into a crowd because he feels somebody disrespected him, we've got a moral problem. There's a hole in that
 young man's heart - a hole that the government alone cannot fix.I believe in vigorous enforcement of our non-discrimination laws
. But I also believe that a transformation of conscience and a genuine commitment to diversity on the part of the nation's CEOs c
ould bring about quicker results than a battalion of lawyers. They have more lawyers than us anyway.I think that we should put mo
re of our tax dollars into educating poor girls and boys. I think that the work that Marian Wright Edelman has done all her life 
is absolutely how we should prioritize our resources in the wealthiest nation on earth. I also think that we should give them the
 information about contraception that can prevent unwanted pregnancies, lower abortion rates, and help assure that that every chi
ld is loved and cherished.But, you know, my Bible tells me that if we train a child in the way he should go, when he is old he wi
ll not turn from it. So I think faith and guidance can help fortify a young woman's sense of self, a young man's sense of respons
ibility, and a sense of reverence that all young people should have for the act of sexual intimacy.I am not suggesting that every
 progressive suddenly latch on to religious terminology - that can be dangerous. Nothing is more transparent than inauthentic exp
ressions of faith. As Jim has mentioned, some politicians come and clap -- off rhythm -- to the choir. We don't need that.In fact
, because I do not believe that religious people have a monopoly on morality, I would rather have someone who is grounded in mora
lity and ethics, and who is also secular, affirm their morality and ethics and values without pretending that they're something t
hey're not. They don't need to do that. None of us need to do that.But what I am suggesting is this - secularists are wrong when 
they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square. Frederick Douglas, Abraham Lincoln
, Williams Jennings Bryant, Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King - indeed, the majority of great reformers in American history - were 
not only motivated by faith, but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause. So to say that men and women should
 not inject their "personal morality" into public policy debates is a practical absurdity. Our law is by definition a codificatio
n of morality, much of it grounded in the Judeo-Christian tradition.Moreover, if we progressives shed some of these biases, we mi
ght recognize some overlapping values that both religious and secular people share when it comes to the moral and material direct
ion of our country. We might recognize that the call to sacrifice on behalf of the next generation, the need to think in terms of
 "thou" and not just "I," resonates in religious congregations all across the country. And we might realize that we have the abil
ity to reach out to the evangelical community and engage millions of religious Americans in the larger project of American renewa
l.Some of this is already beginning to happen. Pastors, friends of mine like Rick Warren and T.D. Jakes are wielding their enormo
us influences to confront AIDS, Third World debt relief, and the genocide in Darfur. Religious thinkers and activists like our go
od friend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo are lifting up the Biblical injunction to help the poor as a means of mobilizing Christians
 against budget cuts to social programs and growing inequality.And by the way, we need Christians on Capitol Hill, Jews on Capito
l Hill and Muslims on Capitol Hill talking about the estate tax. When you've got an estate tax debate that proposes a trillion do
llars being taken out of social programs to go to a handful of folks who don't need and weren't even asking for it, you know that
 we need an injection of morality in our political debate.Across the country, individual churches like my own and your own are sp
onsoring day care programs, building senior centers, helping ex-offenders reclaim their lives, and rebuilding our gulf coast in t
he aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.So the question is, how do we build on these still-tentative partnerships between religious and
 secular people of good will? It's going to take more work, a lot more work than we've done so far. The tensions and the suspicio
ns on each side of the religious divide will have to be squarely addressed. And each side will need to accept some ground rules f
or collaboration.While I've already laid out some of the work that progressive leaders need to do, I want to talk a little bit ab
out what conservative leaders need to do -- some truths they need to acknowledge.For one, they need to understand the critical ro
le that the separation of church and state has played in preserving not only our democracy, but the robustness of our religious p
ractice. Folks tend to forget that during our founding, it wasn't the atheists or the civil libertarians who were the most effect
ive champions of the First Amendment. It was the persecuted minorities, it was Baptists like John Leland who didn't want the esta
blished churches to impose their views on folks who were getting happy out in the fields and teaching the scripture to slaves. It
 was the forbearers of the evangelicals who were the most adamant about not mingling government with religious, because they did 
not want state-sponsored religion hindering their ability to practice their faith as they understood it.Moreover, given the incre
asing diversity of America's population, the dangers of sectarianism have never been greater. Whatever we once were, we are no lo
nger just a Christian nation; we are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, a Buddhist nation, a Hindu nation, and a nation of no
nbelievers.And even if we did have only Christians in our midst, if we expelled every non-Christian from the United States of Ame
rica, whose Christianity would we teach in the schools? Would we go with James Dobson's, or Al Sharpton's? Which passages of Scri
pture should guide our public policy? Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is ok and that eating shellfish is abom
ination? How about Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith? Or should we just stick to the Ser
mon on the Mount - a passage that is so radical that it's doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application?
 So before we get carried away, let's read our bibles. Folks haven't been reading their bibles.This brings me to my second point.
 Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific, values.
 It requires that their proposals be subject to argument, and amenable to reason. I may be opposed to abortion for religious reas
ons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will. I
 have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith a
t all.Now this is going to be difficult for some who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, as many evangelicals do. But in a plu
ralistic democracy, we have no choice. Politics depends on our ability to persuade each other of common aims based on a common re
ality. It involves the compromise, the art of what's possible. At some fundamental level, religion does not allow for compromise.
 It's the art of the impossible. If God has spoken, then followers are expected to live up to God's edicts, regardless of the con
sequences. To base one's life on such uncompromising commitments may be sublime, but to base our policy making on such commitment
s would be a dangerous thing. And if you doubt that, let me give you an example.We all know the story of Abraham and Isaac. Abrah
am is ordered by God to offer up his only son, and without argument, he takes Isaac to the mountaintop, binds him to an altar, an
d raises his knife, prepared to act as God has commanded.Of course, in the end God sends down an angel to intercede at the very l
ast minute, and Abraham passes God's test of devotion.But it's fair to say that if any of us leaving this church saw Abraham on a
 roof of a building raising his knife, we would, at the very least, call the police and expect the Department of Children and Fam
ily Services to take Isaac away from Abraham. We would do so because we do not hear what Abraham hears, do not see what Abraham s
ees, true as those experiences may be. So the best we can do is act in accordance with those things that we all see, and that we 
all hear, be it common laws or basic reason.Finally, any reconciliation between faith and democratic pluralism requires some sens
e of proportion.This goes for both sides.Even those who claim the Bible's inerrancy make distinctions between Scriptural edicts, 
sensing that some passages - the Ten Commandments, say, or a belief in Christ's divinity - are central to Christian faith, while 
others are more culturally specific and may be modified to accommodate modern life.The American people intuitively understand thi
s, which is why the majority of Catholics practice birth control and some of those opposed to gay marriage nevertheless are oppos
ed to a Constitutional amendment to ban it. Religious leadership need not accept such wisdom in counseling their flocks, but they
 should recognize this wisdom in their politics.But a sense of proportion should also guide those who police the boundaries betwe
en church and state. Not every mention of God in public is a breach to the wall of separation - context matters. It is doubtful t
hat children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance feel oppressed or brainwashed as a consequence of muttering the phrase "under God.
" I didn't. Having voluntary student prayer groups use school property to meet should not be a threat, any more than its use by t
he High School Republicans should threaten Democrats. And one can envision certain faith-based programs - targeting ex-offenders 
or substance abusers - that offer a uniquely powerful way of solving problems.So we all have some work to do here. But I am hopef
ul that we can bridge the gaps that exist and overcome the prejudices each of us bring to this debate. And I have faith that mill
ions of believing Americans want that to happen. No matter how religious they may or may not be, people are tired of seeing faith
 used as a tool of attack. They don't want faith used to belittle or to divide. They're tired of hearing folks deliver more scree
d than sermon. Because in the end, that's not how they think about faith in their own lives.So let me end with just one other int
eraction I had during my campaign. A few days after I won the Democratic nomination in my U.S. Senate race, I received an email f
rom a doctor at the University of Chicago Medical School that said the following:"Congratulations on your overwhelming and inspir
ing primary win. I was happy to vote for you, and I will tell you that I am seriously considering voting for you in the general e
lection. I write to express my concerns that may, in the end, prevent me from supporting you."The doctor described himself as a C
hristian who understood his commitments to be "totalizing." His faith led him to a strong opposition to abortion and gay marriage
, although he said that his faith also led him to question the idolatry of the free market and quick resort to militarism that se
emed to characterize much of the Republican agenda.But the reason the doctor was considering not voting for me was not simply my 
position on abortion. Rather, he had read an entry that my campaign had posted on my website, which suggested that I would fight 
"right-wing ideologues who want to take away a woman's right to choose." The doctor went on to write:"I sense that you have a str
ong sense of justice...and I also sense that you are a fair minded person with a high regard for reason...Whatever your convictio
ns, if you truly believe that those who oppose abortion are all ideologues driven by perverse desires to inflict suffering on wom
en, then you, in my judgment, are not fair-minded....You know that we enter times that are fraught with possibilities for good an
d for harm, times when we are struggling to make sense of a common polity in the context of plurality, when we are unsure of what
 grounds we have for making any claims that involve others...I do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion, only that you s
peak about this issue in fair-minded words."Fair-minded words.So I looked at my website and found the offending words. In fairnes
s to them, my staff had written them using standard Democratic boilerplate language to summarize my pro-choice position during th
e Democratic primary, at a time when some of my opponents were questioning my commitment to protect Roe v. Wade.Re-reading the do
ctor's letter, though, I felt a pang of shame. It is people like him who are looking for a deeper, fuller conversation about reli
gion in this country. They may not change their positions, but they are willing to listen and learn from those who are willing to
 speak in fair-minded words. Those who know of the central and awesome place that God holds in the lives of so many, and who refu
se to treat faith as simply another political issue with which to score points.So I wrote back to the doctor, and I thanked him f
or his advice. The next day, I circulated the email to my staff and changed the language on my website to state in clear but simp
le terms my pro-choice position. And that night, before I went to bed, I said a prayer of my own - a prayer that I might extend t
he same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me.And that night, before I went to bed I said a pray
er of my own. It's a prayer I think I share with a lot of Americans. A hope that we can live with one another in a way that recon
ciles the beliefs of each with the good of all. It's a prayer worth praying, and a conversation worth having in this country in t
he months and years to come. Thank you. Floor Statement on Bushs Decision to Increase Troops in Iraq TOPIC: Iraq January 19, 2007
 Floor Statement on Bushs Decision to Increase Troops in Iraq Complete Text Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on what 
is a roiling debate not only in the Senate but across the country, and that is the President's policy with respect to Iraq. There
 are countless reasons the American people have lost confidence in the President's Iraq policy, but chief among them has been the
 administration's insistence on making promises and assurances about progress and victory that do not appear to be grounded in th
e reality of the facts. We have been told we would be greeted as liberators. We have been promised the insurgency was in its last
 throes. We have been assured again and again that we are making progress and that the Iraqis would soon stand up so we could sta
nd down and our brave sons and daughters could start coming home. We have been asked to wait, we have been asked to be patient, a
nd we have been asked to give the President and the new Iraqi Government 6 more months, and then 6 more months after that, and th
en 6 more months after that.Now, after the loss of more than 3,000 American lives, after spending almost $400 billion, after Iraq
 has descended into civil war, we have been promised, once again, that the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq will, thi
s time, be well planned, well coordinated, and well supported by the Iraqi Government. This time, we didn't have to wait to find 
out that none of this seems to be the case. Already, American military officials have told the New York Times that there is no cl
ear chain of command between Iraqis and U.S. commanders and no real indication that the Iraqis even want such a partnership. Yest
erday, Prime Minister al-Maliki, the person whom the President said had brought this plan to us, the man who is supposed to be ou
r partner-in-chief for this new plan, told foreign journalists that if the United States would only give his Army better weapons 
and equipment, our soldiers could go home.The President's decision to move forward with this escalation anyway, despite all evide
nce and military advice to the contrary, is the terrible consequence of the decision to give him the broad, open-ended authority 
to wage this war back in 2002. Over 4 years later, we can't revisit that decision or reverse some of the tragic outcomes, but wha
t we can do is make sure we provide the kind of oversight and constraints on the President this time that we failed to do the las
t time.I cannot in good conscience support this escalation. It is a policy which has already been tried and a policy which has fa
iled. Just this morning, I had veterans of the Iraq war visit my office to explain to me that this surge concept is, in fact, no 
different from what we have repeatedly tried, but with 20,000 troops, we will not in any imaginable way be able to accomplish any
 new progress.The fact is that we have tried this road before. In the end, no amount of American forces can solve the political d
ifferences that lie at the heart of somebody else's civil war. As the President's own military commanders have said, escalation o
nly prevents the Iraqis from taking more responsibility for their own future. It is even eroding our efforts in the wider war on 
terror as some of the extra soldiers will come directly from Afghanistan, where the Taliban has become resurgent.The President ha
s offered no evidence that more U.S. troops will be able to pressure Shias, Sunnis, and Kurds toward the necessary political sett
lement, and he has attached no consequences to his plan should the Iraqis fail to make progress. In fact, just last week, when I 
repeatedly asked Secretary Rice what would happen if the Iraqi Government failed to meet the benchmarks the President has called 
for and says are an integral part of their rationale for escalation, she couldn't give me an answer. When I asked her if there we
re any circumstances whatsoever in which we would tell the Iraqis that their failure to make progress means the end of our milita
ry commitment, she could not give me an answer. This is simply not good enough. When you ask how many more months and how many mo
re dollars and how many more lives it will take to end the policy that everyone now knows has not succeeded, ``I don't know'' isn
't good enough.Over the past 4 years, we have given this administration every chance to get this right, and they have disappointe
d us many times. But ultimately it is our brave men and women in uniform and their families who bear the greatest burden for thes
e mistakes. They have performed in an exemplary fashion. At no stage have they faltered in the mission that has been presented to
 them.Unfortunately, the strategy, the tactics, and the mission itself have been flawed. That is why Congress now has the duty to
 prevent even more mistakes and bring this war to a responsible end. That is why I plan to introduce legislation which I believe 
will stop the escalation of this war by placing a cap on the number of soldiers in Iraq. I wish to emphasize that I am not unique
 in taking this approach. I know Senator Dodd has crafted similar legislation. Senator Clinton, I believe, yesterday indicated sh
e shared similar views. The cap would not affect the money spent on the war or on our troops, but it would write into law that th
e number of U.S. forces in Iraq should not exceed the number that were there on January 10, 2007, the day the President announced
 his escalation policy.This measure would stop the escalation of the war in Iraq, but it is my belief that simply opposing the su
rge is not good enough. If we truly believe the only solution in Iraq is a political one--and I fervently believe that--if we bel
ieve a phased redeployment of U.S. forces in Iraq is the best--perhaps only--leverage we have to force a settlement between the c
ountry's warring factions, then we should act on that. That is why the second part of my legislation is a plan for phased redeplo
yment that I called for in a speech in Chicago 2 months ago. It is a responsible plan that protects American troops without causi
ng Iraq to suddenly descend into chaos. The President must announce to the Iraqi people that within 2 to 4 months, under this pla
n, U.S. policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces. The President should then work with our military 
commanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and determine precise levels and dates.Drawing down our troops in Ira
q will put pressure on Iraqis to arrive at the political settlement that is needed and allow us to redeploy additional troops in 
Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region, as well as bring some back home. The forces redeployed elsewhere in the region could the
n help to prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, something that every international observer is beginning to wor
ry about. It will also reassure our allies in the Gulf. It will allow our troops to strike directly at al-Qaida wherever it may e
xist and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.My plan would couple t
his phased redeployment with an enhanced effort to train Iraqi security forces and would expand the number of our personnel--espe
cially special forces--who are deployed with Iraqis as unit advisers and would finally link continued economic aid in Iraq with t
he existence of tangible progress toward reducing sectarian violence and reaching a political settlement.One final aspect of this
 plan that I believe is critical is it would call for engagement by the United States in a regional conference with other countri
es that are involved in the Middle East--particularly our allies, but including Syria and Iran--to find a solution to the war in 
Iraq. We have to realize that neither Iran nor Syria wants to see the security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refug
ees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region and within their own countries. So as odi
ous as the behavior of those regimes may be at times, it is important that we include them in a broader conversation about how we
 can stabilize Iraq.In closing, let me say this: I have been a consistent and strong opponent of this war. I have also tried to a
ct responsibly in that opposition to ensure that, having made the decision to go into Iraq, we provide our troops, who perform va
liantly, the support they need to complete their mission. I have also stated publicly that I think we have both strategic interes
ts and humanitarian responsibilities in ensuring that Iraq is as stable as possible under the circumstances.Finally, I said publi
cly that it is my preference not to micromanage the Commander-in-Chief in the prosecution of war. Ultimately, I do not believe th
at is the ideal role for Congress to play. But at a certain point, we have to draw a line. At a certain point, the American peopl
e have to have some confidence that we are not simply going down this blind alley in perpetuity.When it comes to the war in Iraq,
 the time for promises and assurances, for waiting and patience is over. Too many lives have been lost and too many billions have
 been spent for us to trust the President on another tried-and-failed policy, opposed by generals and experts, opposed by Democra
ts and Republicans, opposed by Americans and even the Iraqis themselves. It is time to change our policy. It is time to give Iraq
is their country back, and it is time to refocus America's effort on the wider struggle against terror yet to be won. Floor State
ment of Support for Stem Cell Research TOPIC: Healthcare & Health Issues July 17, 2006 Statement of Support for Stem Cell Researc
h Complete Text Mr. President, a few weeks ago I was visited by two of my constituents-- Mary Schneider and her son Ryan.When Rya
n was just two years old, his parents and doctors noted severe delays in his motor and speech development, and he was diagnosed w
ith cerebral palsy. His parents were devastated, as the prognosis for many children with cerebral palsy is quite grim, and given 
the severity of Ryan's condition, his doctors didn't have much hope for his improvement.Yet, his parents had hope. Because when R
yan was born, his parents had saved his cord blood, a viable but limited source of stem cells. They found a doctor at Duke Univer
sity who was willing to perform an experimental infusion with these cells to see if they might improve his condition.They did. In
 fact, they seem to have cured him.Within months of the infusion, Ryan was able to speak, use his arms, and eat normally, just li
ke any other child - a miracle his family had once only dreamed of.Ryan's story exemplifies the power and the promise of stem cel
ls to treat and cure the millions of Americans who are suffering from catastrophic, debilitating and life-threatening diseases an
d health conditions.Each year, 100,000 Americans will develop Alzheimer's disease. Over 1 million adults will be diagnosed with d
iabetes this year, which can lead to complications such as blindness, damaged nerves and loss of kidney function. And there are f
ar too many individuals with spinal cord injuries who are struggling to maintain mobility and independence.For most of our histor
y, medicine has offered little hope of recovery to individuals affected by these and other devastating illnesses and injuries.Unt
il now.Recent developments in stem cell research may hold the key to improved treatments, if not cures, for those affected by Alz
heimer's disease, diabetes, spinal cord injury and countless other conditions.Many men, women and children who are cancer survivo
rs are already familiar with the life-saving applications of adult stem cell research. Patients with leukemia or lymphoma often u
ndergo bone marrow transplants, a type of stem cell transplant, which can significantly prolong life, or permanently get rid of t
he cancer. This therapy has been used successfully for decades, and is saving lives everyday.Yet this breakthrough has its seriou
s limitations. Adult stem cells, such as those used in bone marrow transplants, can only be collected in small quantities, may no
t be a match for the patient, and have limited ability to transform into specialized cells.Cord blood, like the kind Ryan used, h
as limitations as well. If, for example, young Ryan's condition should deteriorate or he should develop another illness, there si
mply are not enough cord blood cells left for a second use. His mother has told us that the few remaining cells would have to be 
cloned to get enough cells for future use, or they would have to obtain stem cells from another source.These and other difficulti
es are the reasons why scientists have started to explore other types and other sources for stem cells, including embryonic stem 
cell research.Embryonic stem cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including in vitro fertilization. At this very momen
t, there are over 400,000 embryos being stored in over 400 facilities throughout the United States. The majority of these are res
erved for infertile couples. However, many of these embryos will go unused, destined for permanent storage in a freezer or dispos
al. We should expand and accelerate research using these embryos, just as we should continue to explore the viability of adult st
em cell use and cord blood use.All over the country, exciting progress is being made in the area of embryonic stem cell research.
 At the University of Illinois, they're finding that stem cells have the potential to treat blood disorders, lung diseases, and h
eart damage.At Johns Hopkins, researchers were able to use mouse embryonic stem cells to repair damaged nerves and restore mobili
ty in paralyzed rats. One can't help but think that it's a matter of when, not if, this research will be able to one day help tho
se who have lost the ability to walk.For these reasons, I'm proud to be a long-term supporter of greater stem cell research. Whil
e I was a member of the Illinois Senate, I was the chief cosponsor of the Ronald Reagan Biomedical Research Act, which would spec
ifically permit embryonic stem cell research in Illinois, and establish review of this research by the Illinois Department of Pub
lic Health.And I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the stem cell bill before us today. This bill embodies the innovative thinking that
 we as a society demand and medical advancement requires. By expanding scientific access to embryonic stem cells which would be o
therwise discarded, this bill will help our nation's scientists and researchers develop treatments and cures to help people who s
uffer from illnesses and injuries for which there are currently none. But the bill is not without limits; it requires that scient
ific research also be subject to rigorous oversight.I realize there are moral and ethical issues surrounding this debate. But I a
lso realize that we're not talking about harvesting cells that would've been used to create life and we're not talking about clon
ing humans. We're talking about using stem cells that would have otherwise been discarded and lost forever - and we're talking ab
out using those stem cells to possibly save the lives of millions of Americans.Democrats want this bill to pass. Conservative, pr
o-life Republicans want this bill to pass. By large margins, the American people want this bill to pass. It is only the White Hou
se standing in the way of progress - standing in the way of so many potential cures.I would only ask that the President thinks ab
out this before he picks up his pen to deliver his first veto in six years. I would ask that he thinks about Ryan Schneider and h
is parents, and all the other families who are sitting and waiting and praying for a cure - hoping that somewhere, a researcher o
r scientist will find the answer.There was a time in the middle of the last century when America watched helplessly as a mysterio
us disease left thousands - especially children - disabled for life. The medical community worked tirelessly to try and find a cu
re, but they needed help - they needed funding to make their research possible.With a world war raging and the country still emer
ging from depression, the federal government could have ignored their plight or told them to find a cure on their own.But that di
dn't happen. Instead, Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped galvanize a community of compassion and organize the March of Dimes to fin
d the cure for polio. And while Roosevelt knew that his own polio would never be cured by the discovery of a vaccine, he also kne
w that at its best, government can be used as a force to accomplish together what we cannot achieve on our own.And so the people 
began to care and the dimes piled up and the funding started to flow, and fifty years ago, Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccin
e.Americans are looking for that kind of leadership today. All over the country, patients and their families are waiting today fo
r Congress and the President to open the door to the cures of tomorrow. At the dawn of the 21st century, we should approach this 
research with the same passion and commitment that have led to so many cures and saved so many lives throughout our history.I urg
e my colleagues to support this bill. Thank you. National Women's Law Center TOPIC: Civil Rights November 10, 2005 Remarks of Sen
ator Barack Obama National Women's Law Center National Complete Text Thank you Duffy for that generous introduction, and I also w
ant to thank you and Marcia and the National Women's Law Center for inviting me here.As I was thinking about tonight's dinner and
 all the progress the women's movement has made in the last century, the first thing that came to mind wasn't all the legal cases
 won or the legislation passed; it wasn't the issues debated or even the individual rights secured.I thought about my daughters.I
 thought about the world that Sasha and Malia will grow up in, about the chances they'll have and the challenges they'll face. An
d I thought about my hopes for them - that they'll be able to dream without limit, achieve without constraint, and be free to see
k their own happiness.At its heart, this has always been the essence of the women's movement in America - the quest to ensure tha
t our daughters will have the same opportunities as our sons.Now, I realize that one day, my girls will discover that this journe
y is not over - that there are doors left to be open and glass ceilings yet to be shattered.But if they ever come to me and ask w
hether change is possible - whether it's worth trying - then the people in this room and all those who've come before will have g
iven me an inspiring story to tell.I'll tell my daughters that there was a time when no one asked a young woman what she wanted t
o be when she grew up because everyone already knew the answer.But then women stood up and changed that answer.I'll tell them the
re was a time when women were routinely passed over for jobs that went to less qualified men; when they'd lose their jobs for the
 crime of becoming pregnant; when female athletes would lose out on thousands in college scholarships - a time when all of this w
as sanctioned by the law.But then women stood up and changed those laws.I'll tell them there was a time when women could be openl
y harassed and demeaned and abused right in the place where they worked or went to school.But then brave Americans like Anne Ladk
y and Nancy Kreiter stood up and women everywhere were protected.And when my daughters ask me whether change is possible, I'll te
ll them that there was a time when a woman who graduated third in her class at one of the most prestigious law schools in the cou
ntry couldn't find a single firm in America that would hire her. And that with all her talent and brilliance, she had to start he
r career as an unpaid assistant to a legal secretary at a county attorney's office in Arizona.But I'll also mention that years la
ter, the progress made by the women's movement made it possible for Sandra Day O'Connor to leave Arizona and become the first fem
ale justice of the United States Supreme Court. And today, if they want to find a female lawyer in a position of prominence, they
 need look no further than the one they call Mom.I will tell them all of this not to understate the challenges women face in this
 new century - challenges to choice and about pay and violence and employment and family - but to illustrate that in all the stru
ggles of past generations, one of the most remarkable achievements of this very American movement has been to forge a consensus a
round this ideal of equal opportunity - around the notion that discrimination based on gender has no place in our society or in o
ur laws.The result of this consensus is that today, if you ask any number of men, women, Democrats, Republicans, liberals or cons
ervatives, "Do you believe that your daughters should have the same opportunities as your sons?", the answer you would hear most 
frequently is "Of course." And when you say "of course," it becomes harder to argue that women shouldn't get equal pay for an equ
al day's work, or that they shouldn't get the support they need to be good workers and good parents at the same time.The other si
de knows this - they know that equal opportunity has always been a winning argument for us. And that's why those who don't want t
o make it a reality choose to fight on other terms. They make sure that in any given campaign or debate, the only woman's issue t
hat ever comes up is not equal pay or health care or family leave, but the narrowest, most divisive issues like late-term abortio
n.Now, the ability for a woman to make decisions about how many children to have and when - without interference from the governm
ent - is one of the most fundamental freedoms we have. We all know, becoming a parent is one of the most - if not the most - impo
rtant jobs there is. No one should make that decision for a woman and her family but them. And we must keep defending their right
 to make this choice in the years to come.But even as we defend this right, it's important for us to acknowledge the moral dimens
ion to the choice that's made. Too often in our advocacy, we forget that. And yet we know that many women who make the choice may
 never forget the difficulty that accompanies it. I noticed that when Hillary Clinton acknowledged this in a speech earlier this 
year, some criticized her. But she was merely recognizing an important moral reality for many.I also think that whenever possible
, we need frame choice within the broader context of equality and opportunity for women. Because when we argue big, we win. But w
hen the entire struggle for opportunity is narrowed, it plays into the hands of those who thrive on the politics of division; who
 win by fueling culture wars.A few weeks ago, I was in Nebraska speaking at the local chapter of Girls, Inc. As many of you know,
 this is an organization that, for over a century, has helped young women gain self-esteem and opportunity through programs that 
build job and educational skills, encourage health awareness, and send women to college on scholarships. Recently, the American G
irl doll company decided to help out Girls, Inc. by selling special bracelets and donating the proceeds to the organization - a g
esture that seems both harmless and well-intentioned.Unless, of course, you're the conservative right, in which case the most sen
sible response is to call for a boycott of American Girl. Because apparently, even though it's an issue they don't discuss much a
nd barely mention on their website, Girls, Inc. happens to believe in a woman's right to choose and support for girls regardless 
of their sexual orientation. And so just like that, an organization dedicated to expanding horizons and providing new opportunity
 for young women is turned into a front for "abortion-on-demand."This is what they do. But we don't have to let them drag us into
 it. There's too much still at stake for women on too many different issues for us to keep fighting on their terms. Here at NWLC,
 you work on child care and education and health care and welfare and employment - and there's no reason that work should be drow
ned out by a cultural jihad.In the coming weeks, many will be scouring the record of Judge Alito to find out exactly where he sta
nds on choice. Since he would replace a pivotal swing vote on the Court, this makes sense. But Sandra Day O'Connor was an indepen
dent voice on a host of important women's issues - and her story exemplifies the equality of opportunity at the heart of the wome
n's movement.Whether Samuel Alito will put the law on the side of upholding this ideal for every American should be at the center
 of our inquiry into his judicial philosophy, and I know that NWLC will be leading the way on this.It's time to find strength in 
this movement's roots of opportunity. At a time where the forces of globalization are transforming the way we work and live, this
 means taking a new look at the way government can help create economic opportunity for all Americans. In this debate, which has 
only just begun, it's women who have the most at stake, and women who should be the strongest voices.The social contract between 
Americans and their government - the bargain that says if you're willing to work hard for your country then your country will mak
e it easier for you to get ahead and raise a family - was made for a time when most women stayed home with the kids and most work
ers stayed with one company for their entire lives.But even though this time is long past - even though the vast majority of wome
n with children today are working, including single mothers - we still have social policies designed around the old model of the 
male breadwinner.And so women still earn 76% of what men do. They receive less in health benefits, less in pensions, less in Soci
al Security. They receive little help for the rising cost of child care. They make up 71% of all Medicaid beneficiaries, and a fu
ll two-thirds of all the Americans who lost their health care this year. When women go on maternity leave, America is the only co
untry in the industrialized world to let them go unpaid. When their children become sick and are sent home from school, many moth
ers are forced to choose between caring for their child and keeping their job.In short, when it comes to making your way in a twe
nty-first century economy, our daughters still do not have the same opportunities as our sons.The Administration's answer to this
 would only exacerbate the problem for women. The idea here is to give everyone one big refund on their government - divvy it up 
into some tax breaks, hand them out, and encourage everyone to use their share to go buy their own health care, their own retirem
ent plan, their own unemployment insurance, education, and so forth.But for the single mom who's already making less than her mal
e counterpart - the mom who had to go without a paycheck for three months when her daughter was born, who's now facing skyrocketi
ng child care costs and an employer who doesn't provide health care coverage for part-time work - for this mom, getting a few hun
dred bucks off the next tax bill won't solve the problem, will it?In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society. But in our
 past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism, every man and woman for him or herself. It allows us to say to those
 whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - tough luck. It allows us to say to the women who lose their 
jobs when they have to care for a sick child - life isn't fair. It let's us say to the child born into poverty - pull yourself up
 by your bootstrapsBut there is a problem. It won't work. It ignores our history. Our economic dominance has depended on individu
al initiative and belief in the free market; but it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that
 everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunityAnd so if we're ser
ious about this opportunity, if we truly value families and don't think it's right to penalize parenting, then we need to start a
cting like it. We need to update the social contract in this country to include the realities faced by working women.When a paren
t takes parental leave, we shouldn't act like caring for a newborn baby is a three-month break - we should let them keep their sa
lary. When parents are working and their children need care, we should make sure that care is affordable, and we should make sure
 our kids can go to school earlier and longer so they have a safe place to learn while their parents are at work. When a mom or a
 dad has to leave work to care for a sick child, we should make sure it doesn't result in a pink slip. When a woman does lose a j
ob, she should get unemployment insurance even if the job loss was due to a family emergency and even if she's looking for a part
-time job. And in an economy where health and pension coverage are shrinking, where people switch jobs multiple times and women d
on't always depend on their husbands for benefits, we should have portable health care plans and pensions that any individual can
 take with them to any part-time or full-time job and Medicaid that's there when you need it.These are ideas that you've all been
 fighting for here at NWLC; ideas that go beyond the culture wars we're used to and should be able to get support on both sides o
f the aisle. Ideas that - at their core - are about expanding opportunity for our daughters.The other day, I was reading through 
Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America.At one point, 
Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing
 twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school. The first was in hairstyling; the other in b
raiding.Another girl, Mireya, listened as her friend told this story. And she began to cry. When asked what was wrong, she said, 
"I don't want to take hairdressing. I did not need sewing either. I knew how to sew. My mother is a seamstress in a factory. I'm 
trying to go to college. I don't need to sew to go to college. My mother sews. I hoped for something else."I hoped for something 
elseFrom the first moment a woman dared to speak that hope - dared to believe that the American Dream was meant for her too - ord
inary women have taken on extraordinary odds to give their daughters the chance for something else; for a life more equal, more f
ree, and filled with more opportunity than they ever had. In so many ways we have succeeded, but in so many areas we have much wo
rk left to do. The National Women's Law Center has been at the forefront of this journey, and I look forward to working with you 
as you continue to spread hope and expand opportunity for young women in the years to come. Thank you. Martin Luther King Jr. Nat
ional Memorial Groundbreaking TOPIC: Civil Rights November 13, 2006 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Groundbreaking C
eremony Complete Text THIS PARAGRAGH IS SPOKEN BEFORE THE VIDEO BEGINS: I want to thank first of all the King family, we would no
t be here without them, I want to thank Mr. Johnson and the foundation for allowing me to share this day with all of you. I wish 
to recognize as well my colleagues in the United States Senate who have helped make today possible. Senators Paul Sarbanes and Jo
hn Warner, who wrote the bill for this memorial. Senators Thad Cochran and Robert Byrd who appropriated the money to help build i
t. Thank you all.I have two daughters, ages five and eight. And when I see the plans for this memorial, I think about what it wil
l like when I first bring them here upon the memorial's completion. I imagine us walking down to this tidal basin, between one me
morial dedicated to the man who helped give birth to a nation, and another dedicated to the man who preserved it. I picture us wa
lking beneath the shadows cast by the Mountain of Despair, and gazing up at the Stone of Hope, and reading the quotes on the wall
 together as the water falls like rain.And at some point, I know that one of my daughters will ask, perhaps my youngest, will ask
, "Daddy, why is this monument here? What did this man do?"How might I answer them? Unlike the others commemorated in this place,
 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was not a president of the United States - at no time in his life did he hold public office. He was n
ot a hero of foreign wars. He never had much money, and while he lived he was reviled at least as much as he was celebrated. By h
is own accounts, he was a man frequently racked with doubt, a man not without flaws, a man who, like Moses before him, more than 
once questioned why he had been chosen for so arduous a task - the task of leading a people to freedom, the task of healing the f
estering wounds of a nation's original sin.And yet lead a nation he did. Through words he gave voice to the voiceless. Through de
eds he gave courage to the faint of heart. By dint of vision, and determination, and most of all faith in the redeeming power of 
love, he endured the humiliation of arrest, the loneliness of a prison cell, the constant threats to his life, until he finally i
nspired a nation to transform itself, and begin to live up to the meaning of its creed.Like Moses before him, he would never live
 to see the Promised Land. But from the mountain top, he pointed the way for us - a land no longer torn asunder with racial hatre
d and ethnic strife, a land that measured itself by how it treats the least of these, a land in which strength is defined not sim
ply by the capacity to wage war but by the determination to forge peace - a land in which all of God's children might come togeth
er in a spirit of brotherhood.We have not yet arrived at this longed for place. For all the progress we have made, there are time
s when the land of our dreams recedes from us - when we are lost, wandering spirits, content with our suspicions and our angers, 
our long-held grudges and petty disputes, our frantic diversions and tribal allegiances.And yet, by erecting this monument, we ar
e reminded that this different, better place beckons us, and that we will find it not across distant hills or within some hidden 
valley, but rather we will find it somewhere in our hearts.In the Book of Micah, Chapter 6, verse 8, the prophet says that God ha
s already told us what is good."What doth the Lord require of thee, the verse tells us, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and 
to walk humbly with thy God?"The man we honor today did what God required. In the end, that is what I will tell my daughters - I 
will leave it to their teachers and their history books to tell them the rest. As Dr. King asked to be remembered, I will tell th
em that this man gave his life serving others. I will tell them that this man tried to love somebody. I will tell them that becau
se he did these things, they live today with the freedom God intended, their citizenship unquestioned, their dreams unbounded. An
d I will tell them that they too can love. That they too can serve. And that each generation is beckoned anew, to fight for what 
is right, and strive for what is just, and to find within itself the spirit, the sense of purpose, that can remake a nation and t
ransform a world. Thank you very much. NAACP FIGHT FOR FREEDOM FUND DINNERTOPIC: Civil Rights May 1st, 2005 NAACP Fight for Freed
om Fund Dinner Detroit, MI Complete Text Thank you. Half a century after the first few hundred people sat for justice and equalit
y at these tables, I am honored to be here with this crowd of thousands at the 50th NAACP Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner.Founded a
t a time when we were constantly reminded how the world around us was separate and unequal...when the idea of legal rights for bl
ack folks was almost a contradiction in terms...when lunch counters and bus seats and water fountains were luxuries you had to fi
ght for and march for, the 50th anniversary of the Fight for Freedom Dinner reminds us of just how far our struggle has come.I wa
s reminded of this last month, when I had the honor of going to Atlanta to speak at John Lewis's 65th birthday celebration. Many 
of the luminaries of the Civil Rights Movement were down there, and I had the great honor of sitting between Ethel Kennedy and Co
retta Scott King, who both turned to me and said "we're really looking forward to hearing you speak." Now that's a really intimid
ating thing!And as I stood up there next to John Lewis, not a giant in stature, but a giant of compassion and courage, I thought 
to myself, never in a million years would I have guessed that I'd be serving in Congress with John Lewis.And then I thought, you 
know, there was once a time when John Lewis might never have guessed that he'd be serving in Congress. And there was a time not l
ong before that when people might never have guessed that someday, black folks would be able to go to the polls, pick up a ballot
, make their voice heard, and elect that Congress.But we can, and many of us are here, because people like John Lewis believed. B
ecause people feared nothing and risked everything for those beliefs. Because they saw injustice and endured pain in order to rig
ht what was wrong. We're here tonight because of them, and to them we owe the deepest gratitude.The road we have taken to this po
int has not been easy. But then again, the road to change never is.Some of you might know that I taught Constitutional Law at the
 Chicago Law school for awhile. And one of the courses I taught was a course in race and law, where we chronicled the history of 
race in this country and people's struggle to achieve freedom in the courts and on the streets. And often times my students would
 come up to me and say things like, "Boy I wish I could've been around at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. Because things
 seemed so clear at the time. And while there may have been room for debate on some things, the clarity of the cause and the need
 for the movement were crystal clear, and you didn't have the ambiguities you have today.Because it's one thing to know that ever
yone has a seat at the lunch counter, but how do we figure out how everyone can pay for the meal? It was easy to figure out that 
blacks and whites should be able to go to school together, but how do we make sure that every child is equipped and ready to grad
uate? It was easy to talk about dogs and fire hoses, but how do we talk about getting drugs and guns off the streets?" This is wh
at they told me.And of course, I reminded them that it wasn't very easy at all. That the moral certainties we now take for grante
d - that separate can never be equal, that the blessings of liberty enshrined in our Constitution belong to all of us, that our c
hildren should be able to go to school together and play together and grow up together - were anything but certain in 1965.I remi
nded them that even within the African-American community, there was disagreement about how much to stir things up. We have a chu
rch in Chicago that's on what use to be known as State Park Way. After Dr. King's assassination, the street was renamed to Martin
 Luther King Jr. Drive. But the pastor of the church - a prominent African-American in the community - hated Dr. King so bad that
 he actually changed the address of the church.And so it's never been clear. And it's never been easy. To get to where we are tod
ay it took struggle and sacrifice, discipline and tremendous courage.And sometimes, when I reflect on those giants of the Civil R
ights movement, I wonder - where did you find that courage? John Lewis, where did you find that courage? Dorothy Height, where di
d you find that courage? Rosa Parks, where did you find that courage?When you're facing row after row of state troopers on horseb
ack armed with billy clubs and tear gas...when they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kne
el down, and pray to the Lord for salvation?Where do you find that courage?I don't know. But I do know that it's worth examining 
because the challenges we face today are going to require this kind of courage. The battle lines may have shifted and the barrier
s to equality may be new, but what's not new is the need for everyday heroes to stand up and speak out for what they believe is r
ight.Fifty years ago this country decided that Linda Brown shouldn't have to walk miles and miles to school every morning when th
ere was a white school just four blocks away because when it comes to education in America, separate can never be equal.Now that 
ruling came about because the NAACP was willing to fight tirelessly and risk its reputation; because everyday Americans - black a
nd white - were willing to take to the streets and risk their freedom. Because people showed courage.Fifty years later, what kind
 of courage are we showing to ensure that our schools are foundations of opportunity for our children?In a world where kids from 
Detroit aren't just competing with kids from Macomb for middle-class jobs, but with kids from Malaysia and New Delhi, ensuring th
at every American child gets the best education possible is the new civil rights challenge of our time.A student today armed with
 only a high school diploma will earn an average of only $25,000 a year - if you're African-American, it's 14% less than that. Me
anwhile, countries like China are graduating twice as many students with a college degree as we do. We're falling behind, and if 
want our kids to have the same chances we had in life, we must work harder to catch up.So what are we doing about it?When we see 
that America has one of the highest high school dropout rates in the industrialized world - even higher for African-Americans and
 Hispanics, what are we doing about it?When we see that our high school seniors are scoring lower on their math and science tests
 than almost any other students in the world at a time when expertise in these areas is the ticket to a high-wage job, what are w
e doing about it?When we see that for every hundred students who enter ninth grade, only eighteen - eighteen - will earn any kind
 of college degree within six years of graduating high school, what are we doing about it?And when we see broken schools, old tex
tbooks, and classrooms bursting at the seams, what are we doing about that?I'll tell you what they've been doing in Washington. I
n Washington, they'll talk about the importance of education one day and sign big tax cuts that starve our schools the next. They
'll talk about Leaving No Child Behind but then say nothing when it becomes obvious that they've left the money behind. In the bu
dget they passed this week in Congress, they gave out over $100 billion in tax cuts, on top of the trillions they've already give
n to the wealthiest few and most profitable corporations.One hundred billion dollars. Think about what that could do for our kids
 if we invested that in our schools. Think of how many new schools we could build, how many great teachers we could recruit, what
 kind of computers and technology we could put in our classrooms. Think about how much we could invest in math and science so our
 kids could be prepared for the 21st century economy. Think about how many kids we could send to college who've worked hard, stud
ied hard, but just can't afford the tuition.Think about all that potential and all that opportunity. Think about the choice Washi
ngton made instead. And now think about what you can do about it.I believe we have a mutual responsibility to make sure our schoo
ls are properly funded, our teachers are properly paid, and our students have access to an affordable college education. And if w
e don't do something about all that, than nothing else matters.But I also believe we have an individual responsibility as well.Ou
r grandparents use to tell us that being Black means you have to work twice as hard to succeed in life. And so I ask today, can w
e honestly say our kids are working twice as hard as the kids in India and China who are graduating ahead of us, with better test
 scores and the tools they need to kick our butts on the job market? Can we honestly say our teachers are working twice as hard, 
or our parents?One thing's for sure, I certainly know that Washington's not working twice as hard - and that's something each of 
us has a role in changing. Because if we want change in our education system - if we want our schools to be less crowded and fund
ed more equitably; if we want our children to take the courses that will get them ready for the 21st century; if we want our teac
hers to be paid what they're worth and armed with the tools they need to prepare our kids; than we need to summon the same courag
e today that those giants of the Civil Rights movement summoned half a century ago.Because more than anything else, these anniver
saries - of the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act and Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner - they remind us that in America, or
dinary citizens can somehow find in their hearts the courage to do extraordinary things. That change is never easy, but always po
ssible. And it comes not from violence or militancy or the kind of politics that pits us against each other and plays on our wors
t fears; but from great discipline and organization, and from a strong message of hope.And when we look at these challenges and t
hink, how can we do this? How can we cut through the apathy and the partisanship and the business-as-usual culture in Washington?
 When we wonder this, we need to rediscover the hope that people have been in our shoes before and they've lived to cross those b
ridges.Personally, I find that hope in thinking about a trip I took during my campaign for the U.S. Senate.About a week after the
 primary, Dick Durbin and I embarked on a nineteen city tour of Southern Illinois. And one of the towns we went to was a place ca
lled Cairo, which, as many of you might know, achieved a certain notoriety during the late 60s and early 70s as having one of the
 worst racial climates in the country. You had an active white citizen's council there, you had cross burnings, Jewish families w
ere being harassed, you had segregated schools, race riots, you name it - it was going on in Cairo.And we're riding down to Cairo
 and Dick Durbin turns to me and says, "Let me tell you about the first time I went to Cairo. It was about 30 years ago. I was 23
 years old and Paul Simon, who was Lieutenant Governor at the time, sent me down there to investigate what could be done to impro
ve the racial climate in Cairo."And Dick tells me how he diligently goes down there and gets picked up by a local resident who ta
kes him to his motel. And as Dick's getting out of the car, the driver says "excuse me, let me just give you a piece of advice. D
on't use the phone in your motel room because the switchboard operator is a member of the white citizen's council, and they'll re
port on anything you do."Well, this obviously makes Dick Durbin upset, but he's a brave young man, so he checks in to his room, u
npacks his bags and a few minutes later he hears a knock on the door. He opens up the door and there's a guy standing there who j
ust stares at Dick for a second, and then says, "What the hell are you doing here?" and walks away.Well, now Dick is really feeli
ng concerned and so am I because as he's telling me this story, we're pulling in to Cairo. So I'm wondering what kind of receptio
n we're going to get. And we wind our way through the town and we go past the old courthouse, take a turn and suddenly we're in a
 big parking lot and about 300 people are standing there. About a fourth of them are black and three fourths are white and they a
ll are about the age where they would have been active participants in the epic struggle that had taken place thirty years earlie
r.And as we pull closer, I see something. All of these people are wearing these little buttons that say "Obama for U.S. Senate." 
And they start smiling. And they start waving. And Dick and I looked at each other and didn't have to say a thing. Because if you
 told Dick thirty years ago that he - the son of Lithuania immigrants born into very modest means in east St. Louis - would be re
turning to Cairo as a sitting United States Senator, and that he would have in tow a black guy born in Hawaii with a father from 
Kenya and a mother from Kansas named Barack Obama, no one would have believed it.But it happened. And it happened because John Le
wis and scores of brave Americans stood on that bridge and lived to cross it.You know, two weeks after Bloody Sunday, when the ma
rch finally reached Montgomery, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to the crowd of thousands and said "The arc of the moral universe is
 long, but it bends towards justice." He's right, but you know what? It doesn't bend on its own. It bends because we help it bend
 that way. Because people like John Lewis and Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks and thousands of ordinary Americans with extraord
inary courage have helped bend it that way. And as their examples call out to us from across the generations, we continue to prog
ress as a people because they inspire us to take our own two hands and bend that arc.Congratulations to all of you here at the NA
ACP who are busy bending that arc. Thank you. Network Neutrality - Podcast TOPIC: Technology June 8, 2006 Network Neutrality Snow
e and Dorgan's legislation to protect network neutrality Complete Transcript Hello, this is Senator Barack Obama and today is Thu
rsday, June 8th, 2006.The topic today is net neutrality. The internet today is an open platform where the demand for websites and
 services dictates success. You've got barriers to entry that are low and equal for all comers. And it's because the internet is 
a neutral platform that I can put on this podcast and transmit it over the internet without having to go through some corporate m
edia middleman. I can say what I want without censorship. I don't have to pay a special charge. But the big telephone and cable c
ompanies want to change the internet as we know it. They say they want to create high-speed lanes on the internet and strike excl
usive contractual arrangements with internet content-providers for access to those high-speed lanes. Those of us who can't pony u
p the cash for these high-speed connections will be relegated to the slow lanes.Allowing the Bells and cable companies to act as 
gatekeepers with control over internet access would make the internet like cable. A producer-driven market with barriers to entry
 for website creators and preferential treatment for specific sites based not on merit, the number of hits, but on relationships 
with the corporate gatekeeper. If there were four or more competitive providers of broadband service to every home, then cable an
d telephone companies would not be able to create a bidding war for access to the high-speed lanes. But here's the problem. More 
than 99 percent of households get their broadband services from either cable or a telephone company.So here's my view. We can't h
ave a situation in which the corporate duopoly dictates the future of the internet and that's why I'm supporting what is called n
et neutrality. In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committee reached different conclusions on netwo
rk neutrality. Judiciary Committee members voted to protect net neutrality and commerce voted with the Bells and cable. That deba
te is going to hit the House floor this Friday. In the Senate, Senators Snowe and Dorgan are leading the fight for net neutrality
 and I've joined in that effort. Senator Inouye, the ranking Democrat of the Commerce Committee, has joined us in this effort as 
well and he's working with Senator Stevens to put strong network neutrality into any Senate bill that comes before us. There is w
idespread support among consumer groups, leading academics and the most innovative internet companies, including Google and Yahoo
, in favor of net neutrality. And part of the reason for that is companies like Google and Yahoo might never have gotten started 
had they not been in a position to easily access the internet and do so on the same terms as the big corporate companies that wer
e interested in making money on the internet.I know if you are listening to this podcast that you are going to take an intense in
terest in this issue as well. Congress is going to need to hear your voice because the Bell and cable companies are going to be d
edicating millions of dollars to defeating network neutrality. So I'll keep you updated on this important issue and I look forwar
d to talking to you guys again next week. Bye-bye. Improving Chemical Plant Security - Podcast Transcript TOPIC: Homeland Securit
y March 29, 2006 Improving Chemical Plant Security Senator Barack Obama Complete Transcript Hello, this is Senator Barack Obama a
nd today is Wednesday, March 29, 2006.You know, there has obviously been a lot of talk about homeland security since the tragedy 
of 9/11. We have recently seen the debate flair up around the issue or ports and the nation of Dubai bidding to take over some of
 our critical port infrastructure. In this whole discussion, I think that many of you may not be aware of the degree to which we 
have utterly failed to deal with what may be one of the most significant potential terror threats to this country and that is how
 we protect our chemical plants across the nation.The 9/11 Commission focused specifically on the dangers of our chemical plants,
 how exposed they are. Industrial chemicals such as chlorine, ammonia, phosgene, methyl bromide, hydrochloric and various other a
cids are routinely stored near cities in multi-ton quantities. These chemicals are extraordinarily hazardous. Several are identic
al to those that were used as weapons during the First World War. Today they are 111 facilities in the country where a catastroph
ic chemical release could threaten more than one million people. These plants represent some of the most attractive targets for t
errorists looking to cause wide spread death and destruction. Despite this fact, security at our chemical plants is voluntary. It
's left to the individual plant owners. While many chemical plant owners have taken steps to beef up security, there are a lot wh
o haven't. We are still hearing reports of chemical plants with lap-dated fences, under-sized guard forces, and unprotected tanks
 of hazardous chemicals.Basically these plants are stationary weapons of mass destruction spread all across the country. Their se
curity is light, their facilities are easily entered, and their contents are deadly. Now, five years after 9/11, the federal gove
rnment has done virtually nothing to secure these chemical plants. It's a travesty that the 9/11 Commission, in looking at what h
as been done over the last five years gave us basically an "F" when it came to chemical plant security. So what I've done working
 with Senator Frank Lautenberg from New Jersey, is to introduce legislation that would protect our communities from this potentia
l threat but in a balanced way. There are features in this bill that I think have to be part of any chemical security legislation
 passed by this Congress, and Congress has to go ahead and actually act on legislation in this area.So, here are a couple things 
that the bill does. Number one: it establishes a general duty to improve security at facilities storing threshold amounts of chem
icals. What that means is that chemical facilities would have to take steps to improve security including improving barriers, con
tainment, mitigation, safety training, and where possible, use safer technology. That is known as Inherent Safer Technology, or "
IST," what that means is essentially, plants should use less toxic chemicals, and employ safer procedures where possible.Second t
hing it does is it identifies high priority chemical facilities. It directs the Department of Homeland Security to work with the 
EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as state and local agencies to identify those areas that need special attention
 either because they are close to population centers, the type or amount of chemicals that are involved, their threat to national
 security and critical infrastructure.Third thing: it requires high priority facilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and 
develop and implement response plans. That's something that is not currently done.Fourth thing it does is it says that if states 
decide to create laws that are more stringent than the national standard, they are not preempted; states can make decisions that 
they want even better protection for our chemical plants.Next, it protects whistle-blowers. It protects employees who report dang
erous gaps in security to the Homeland Security Department.Finally, it protects security information from disclosure under the Fr
eedom of Information Act and other state and local disclosure laws, so you don't have chemical plant security measures on the net
 for terrorists to tap into.These are some common sense provisions; unfortunately, the chemical lobby is one of the most powerful
 ones in Washington. It spends more money than just about any other lobby, including the pharmaceutical industry. They have dragg
ed their feet, in terms of wanting to move this issue forward. I understand that there is no company out there that wants to be r
egulated, companies are generally allergic to any intrusion in their business decisions, but this is something of such great impo
rtance that we can't afford to rely solely on voluntary measures.It's overdue; it's time that we acted. My hope is that the Laute
nberg-Obama Chemical Security and Safety Act moves in this Congress and I would urge all of you to contact your legislators to su
ggest that this is in fact something that you guys strongly support.I appreciate your time, and I look forward to talking to you 
next week. Bye bye. Xavier University Commencement Address - New Orleans TOPIC: Commencement and Katrina & Gulf Recovery August 1
1, 2006 Xavier University Commencement Address New Orleans, Louisiana Complete Text Good afternoon President Francis, the Board o
f Trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, and the Class of 2006.I want to start by thanking you all for allowing me to share
 in your miracle today. Over the past year there has been no shortage of doubts about whether this college would live to see anot
her commencement - and doubts remain still about the future of this great city. But on this summer's day in New Orleans, less tha
n one year after the worst storm in American history beat down your door, I look out at the largest class to ever graduate from t
his college and know that one thing is certain - Xavier University is back.I have to say that I'm pretty humbled to be here. Each
 year there are hundreds of commencements in this country. All are hopeful, some are inspiring, and most of you probably won't ev
en remember who your speaker was ten years from now. As a rule, they usually involve an old guy like me giving young folks like y
ou advice about what to expect in the real world - advice about the challenges you'll face and the obstacles you'll have to overc
ome.But this is different. In the last month, I have walked among New Orleans' battered homes and empty streets and scattered deb
ris that prove armies aren't the only ones who can wage wars on cities. I have seen pictures of Xavier after the storm - the subm
erged classrooms and the shattered windows and the dorm rooms that were left with books sitting open on desks and clothes still u
npacked on the bed. And I have heard the story of nearly 400 students and faculty who were trapped on campus in the days after Ka
trina - waiting on the roof to be rescued with a sign that simply read "Help Us."And as I thought about all of this, it dawned on
 me that when it comes to giving advice about challenges and obstacles, it's you who could probably teach the rest of us a thing 
or two about what it takes to overcome.I could give you a lecture on courage, but some of you know what it is to wait huddled in 
the dark without electricity or running water, wondering if a helicopter or boat will come for you before the gunshots get closer
 or the food runs out or the waters rise.I could talk at length about perseverance, but this is a class that was forced to scatte
r to schools across the country at the beginning of your senior year, leaving everything you knew behind while you waited to find
 out if you could ever come back.And I could go on and on about the importance of community - about what it means to care for eac
h other - but this is a school where so many sacrificed so much in order to open your doors in January; a triumph that showed the
 rest of America that there are those who refuse to desert this city and its people no matter what.Yours has been an education th
at cannot simply be measured in the tests you've taken or the diploma you're about to receive. For it has also been an education 
in humanity, brought about by a force of nature - a lesson in both our capacity for good and in the imperfections of man; in our 
ability to rise to great challenges and our tendency to sometimes fall short of our obligations to one another.Some will take an 
entire lifetime to experience these lessons - others never will. But as some of Katrina's youngest survivors, you've had a front 
row seat.So what does this mean for you?Well, lessons can be just as easily unlearned as they are learned. Time may heal, but it 
can also cloud the memory and remove us further from that initial core of concern.And so what this all means is that today and ev
ery day, you have a responsibility to remember what happened here in New Orleans. To make it a part of who you are. To let its le
ssons guide you as face your own challenges.After all, Katrina may well be the most dramatic test you face in life, but it will b
y no means be the last. There will be quiet tests of character - the shoulder you lend a friend during their time of need; the wa
y you raise your children; the care you give a loved one who's sick or dying; the integrity and honesty with which you carry your
self.There will be powerful personal tests - the profession you choose, the legacy you leave, your ability to handle failure and 
disappointment.And of course, there are the tests you will face as citizen - whether you use your voice to rage against injustice
; whether you use your time to give back to your community; whether you use your passion to commit yourself to a cause larger tha
n yourself. In most of these tests, there are two different paths you can take.One is easy. After graduating from a great school 
like Xavier, you'll pretty much be able to punch your own ticket - which means you can take your diploma, walk off this stage, le
ave this city, and go chasing after the big house and the large salary and the nice suits and all the other things that our money
 culture says you should buy.You can live in neighborhoods with people who are exactly like yourself, and send your kids to the s
ame schools, and narrow your concerns to what's going in your own little circle.And when you turn on the TV or open the newspaper
 and hear about all the trouble in the world, there will be pundits and politicians who'll tell you that it's someone else's faul
t and someone else's problem to fix.They'll tell you that the Americans who sleep in the streets and beg for food got there becau
se they're all lazy or weak of spirit. That the immigrants who risk their lives to cross a desert have nothing to contribute to t
his country and no desire to embrace our ideals. That the inner-city children who are trapped in dilapidated schools can't learn 
and won't learn and so we should just give up on them entirely. That the innocent people being slaughtered and expelled from thei
r homes in Darfur are somebody else's problem to take care of.And when you hear all this, the easiest thing in the world will be 
to do nothing at all. To turn off the TV, put down the paper, and walk away from the stories about Iraq or poverty or violence or
 joblessness or hopelessness. To go about your busy lives - to remain detached; to remain indifferent; to remain safe.But if you 
should ever think about taking this path, I ask you first to remember.Remember witnessing the pain that neglect and indifference 
can cause - how entire neighborhoods in this city were left to drown because no one thought to make sure that every person had th
e means to escape. Remember what happens when responsibilities are ignored and bucks are passed - when the White House blames FEM
A and FEMA blames the state of Louisiana and pretty soon no one's fixing the problem because everyone thought somebody else would
. And whenever you're tempted to view the poor or the ill or the persecuted as "those people" - people in their own world with th
eir own problems - remember always your neighbors in places like the 9th ward; men and women and children who, just like you, wan
ted desperately to escape to somewhere better.And if you remember all of this - if you remember what happened here in New Orleans
 - if you allow it to change you forever - know that there is another path you can take.This one is more difficult. It asks more 
of you. It asks you to leave here and not just pursue your own individual dreams, but to help perfect our collective dream as a n
ation. It asks you to realize there is more to life than being rich, thin, young, famous, safe, and entertained. It asks you to r
ecognize that there are people out there who need you.You know, there's a lot of talk in this country about the federal deficit. 
But I think we should talk more about our empathy deficit - the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes; to see the worl
d through the eyes of those who are different from us - the child who's hungry, the steelworker who's been laid-off, the family w
ho lost the entire life they built together when the storm came to town.When you think like this - when you choose to broaden you
r ambit of concern and empathize with the plight of others, whether they are close friends or distant strangers - it becomes hard
er not to act; harder not to help.For each of you, this desire to do for others and serve your communities will come even easier 
if you allow yourself to remember what you saw here in New Orleans.Because aside from all the bad that came from Katrina - the fa
ilures and the neglect, the incompetence and the apathy - you were also witness to a good that many forgot was even possible.You 
saw people from every corner of this country drop what they were doing, leave their homes, and come to New Orleans - Americans wh
o didn't know a soul in the entire city who found their own piece of driftwood, built their own make-shift raft, and waded throug
h the streets of this city, saving anyone they could. You saw the doctors and the nurses who refused to leave their city and thei
r patients even when they were told time and again by local officials that it was no longer safe - even when helicopters were wai
ting to take them away. Men and women who stayed to care for the sick and dying long after their medical equipment and electricit
y were gone.And after the storm had passed, you saw a spirit of generosity that spanned an entire globe, with billions upon billi
ons in donations coming from tiny, far-off nations like Qatar and Sri Lanka. Think about that. These are places a lot of folks co
uldn't even identify on a map. Sri Lanka was still recovering from the devastation caused by last year's Tsunami. And yet, they h
eard about our tragedy, and they gave.Remember always this goodness. Remember always that while many in Washington and on all lev
els of government failed New Orleans, there were plenty of ordinary people who displayed extraordinary humanity during this city'
s hour of need.In the years to come, return this favor to those who are forced to weather their own storms - be it the loss of a 
job or a slide into poverty; an unexpected illness or an unforeseen eviction. And in returning these favors, seek also to make th
is a nation of no more Katrinas. Make this a nation where we never again leave behind any American by ensuring that every America
n has a job that can support a family and health care in case they get sick and a good education for their child and a secure ret
irement they can count on. Make this a nation where we are never again caught unprepared to meet the challenges of our time - whe
re we free ourselves from a dependence on oil and protect our cities from both forces of terror and nature.Make this a nation tha
t is worthy of the sacrifices of so many of its citizens, and in doing so, make real the observation made by a visitor to our cou
ntry so many centuries ago: "America is great because Americans are good."I ask you to take this second path - this harder path -
 not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate, although you do have that obligation. Not because you have a
 debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are, although you do have that debt.I ask you to take it because you have a
n obligation to yourself. Because our individual salvation depends on our collective salvation. And because it's only when you hi
tch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential.It is said that faith is a belief in t
hings not seen, and miracles, by their nature, are inexplicable gifts from God.But sometimes, if we look hard enough at the momen
ts we triumph against the greatest of odds, we can see His will at work in the people He loves.It's now well-known in this commun
ity that when your President, Norman Francis, promised to re-open this school by January, he joked that his decision would be rec
orded by history as either "crazy and stupid" or "bold and visionary."And when I heard that, I wondered where you find the courag
e to make such a crazy, visionary promise - and where you find the commitment to keep it.And I thought, Norman Francis is someone
 who remembers - remembers where he came from, remembers the lessons he learned, remembers the opportunities he's had, and lives 
his life according to those memories.Born in Lafayette before Civil Rights and Voting Rights were even a possibility, this is a m
an who was raised in poverty, earning extra money for his parents as a child by shining shoes. He studied hard through high schoo
l, put himself through Xavier by working long hours in the library, and became the first ever African American to be accepted int
o Loyola's Law School.He graduated that law school and could've gone anywhere and made any amount of money - but Norman Francis w
anted to help people learn because he remembered all the people who helped him.And so he came back to Xavier, and he worked his w
ay up through the ranks, and he became the first ever African-American president of this school at just thirty-six years old.Sinc
e that day he has had many accolades and many chances to do whatever he wished with his life. He has been an advisor to four U.S.
 Presidents, served on a commission to the Vatican, and as President of the United Negro College Fund.But through all of this, he
 decided to stay here in New Orleans, and build this university.And so when Katrina tried to tear it down, you can understand why
 he refused to let that happen - why he put aside tending to the damage in his own house so that he could work on rebuilding this
 one - why he believed more than anything in his promise that these doors would open in January.Norman Francis has helped make to
day's miracle because he has seen miracles at work in his own life. Now that you have seen one in yours, it's your turn to live a
 life committed to others, devoted to the impossible, and ever aware of the lessons you learned in New Orleans.I've noticed that 
in the rebuilding effort throughout this city, one of the last things to come back, and yet the easiest to notice, is the greener
y that makes any community seem alive. And as I saw a newly planted tree on my last trip here, I thought of a passage from the bo
ok of Job:"There is hope for a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again, and that its tender branch will not cease."Katri
na was not the end of the tough times for New Orleans, and you will continue to face your own tests and challenges in the years t
o come. But if someone were to ask me how the tree stands on this August day, I would tell them that the seeds have sprouted, the
 roots are strong, and I just saw more than 500 branches that are ready to grow again. Congratulations on your graduation.Thank y
ou. The American Promise Acceptance Speech at the Democratic Convention Mile High Stadium, Denver Colorado August 28, 2008To Chai
rman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation; With profound gratitude and great 
humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States. Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of can
didates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans a
nd an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton. To President Clinton, who last night made the case for 
change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United S
tates, Joe Biden, I thank you. I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease w
ith everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night. To the love of my life, ou
r next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you. Four years ago, I
 stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who wer
en't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to. It is that
 promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual drea
ms but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well. That's why
 I stand here tonight. Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary m
en and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive. We meet at
 one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been
 threatened once more. Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your h
omes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you 
can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach. These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure t
o respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush. America, we are better
 than these last eight years. We are a better country than this. This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on t
he brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work. This country is more generous
 than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, 
and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news. We are more compassio
nate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a ma
jor American city drowns before our eyes. Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents ac
ross this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise ali
ve. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this count
ry for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On Nov
ember 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough." Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn 
the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll 
also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need. But the 
record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, b
ut really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time? I
 don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change. The truth is, on issue after issue that would ma
ke a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent. 
He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this President. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.
 And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, 
he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners." A natio
n of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up e
very day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to 
the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth
 tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that
 I know. Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't
 know. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundr
eds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred mil
lion Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that w
ould do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement? It's
 not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it. For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old
, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyon
e else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own. Out of work? Tough
 luck. No health care? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't hav
e boots. You're on your own. Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America. You see, we Democr
ats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country. We measure progress by how many people can find a
 job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your
 child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was Presid
ent - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush. We measu
re the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someon
e with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look
 after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work. The fundamentals we use to measure economi
c strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only
 reason I am standing here tonight. Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see m
y grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance 
to go to college on the GI Bill. In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I 
think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps
 but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships. When I listen 
to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I s
tood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed. And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of
 starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, d
espite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the 
one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had int
o me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well. I don't k
now what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stor
ies that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the U
nited States. What is that promise?It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but
 that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect. It's a promise that says the market should reward
 drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, 
look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road. Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our pro
blems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent edu
cation; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology. Our governmen
t should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the mo
st money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work. That's the promise of America - the idea that we are respon
sible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my s
ister's keeper. That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. So let me spell out exactly what that ch
ange would mean if I am President. Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American worke
rs and small businesses who deserve it. Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas
, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America. I will eliminate capital gains taxes for
 the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow. I will cut taxes - cut taxes 
- for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-clas
s. And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten year
s, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East. Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last
 thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standa
rds for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the 
day that Senator McCain took office. Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure
, not a long-term solution. Not even close. As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, a
nd find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future
 are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest 150 billi
on dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation o
f biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced. 
America, now is not the time for small plans.Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-
class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because
 we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest
 in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And
 in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American - if yo
u commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education. Now is the time to fina
lly keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. If you have health care, my plan will lower
 your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as so
meone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those compan
ies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most. Now is the time to help families with paid sick days a
nd better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or
 ailing parent. Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the 
time to protect Social Security for future generations. And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's w
ork, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons. Now, many of these plans will cost money, w
hich is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America gro
w. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we d
o need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy. A
nd Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed s
ense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, governm
ent must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we mu
st provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programs a
lone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must tak
e more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need. Individual responsibility and mutual responsibilit
y - that's the essence of America's promise. And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so mus
t we keep America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve a
s the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have. For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just da
ys after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain
 said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the 
terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have 
them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave 
where he lives. And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and
 even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John 
McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war. That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe
. We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past. You don't defeat a terr
orist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough 
in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow Geo
rge Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need. We are the party of Roosev
elt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't k
eep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans 
- have built, and we are here to restore that legacy. As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I w
ill only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in bat
tle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home. I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight aga
inst al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tou
gh, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnersh
ips to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and dise
ase. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the caus
e of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future. These are the policies I will pursue. And in the we
eks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain. But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positio
ns for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagr
ee without challenging each other's character and patriotism. The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same pa
rtisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The m
en and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and b
led together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have s
erved the United States of America. So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first. America, our work will n
ot be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out
 ideas and politics of the past. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bi
gger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose. And that's what we hav
e to restore. We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this countr
y. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, 
but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are diffe
rences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person th
ey love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefi
ts when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too i
s part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in 
common effort. I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger,
 something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional v
alues. And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If y
ou don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from. You make a big election about s
mall things.And you know what - it's worked before. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. When Washing
ton doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and
 settle for what you already know. I get it. I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typ
ical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington. But I stand before you tonight because all across Americ
a something is stirring. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.
 For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in thi
s election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result
. You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washingto
n. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new idea
s and new leadership, a new politics for a new time. America, this is one of those moments.I believe that as hard as it will be, 
the change we need is coming. Because I've seen it. Because I've lived it. I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care
 to more children and moved more families from welfare to work. I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to 
open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terr
orist hands. And I've seen it in this campaign. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved a
gain after a very long time. In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. I've seen it in th
e workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after
 losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise. This country of o
urs has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's n
ot what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming t
o our shores. Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertai
n; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that be
tter place around the bend. That promise is our greatest inheritance. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in a
t night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a 
promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot. And it is that promise that forty five years ago tod
ay, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and he
ar a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream. The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could'
ve heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred. B
ut what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is 
inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one. "We cannot walk alone," the preacher cried. "And as we walk, we must m
ake the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back." America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be 
done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild an
d farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alo
ne. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise - that American
 promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess. Thank you, and God Bless the
 United States of America. CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE JOHN ROBERTS TOPIC: Confirmations Remarks of Senator Barack Obama Confirmation o
f Judge John Roberts Complete Text First of all, let me congratulate Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for moving the process of 
confirming the nomination of Judge Roberts along with such civility, a civility that I believe speaks well of the Senate.Let me a
lso say that I remain distressed that the White House during this confirmation process, which overall went smoothly, failed to pr
ovide critical documents as part of the record that could have provided us with a better basis to make our judgment with respect 
to the nomination. This White House continues to stymie efforts on the part of the Senate to do its job. I hope with the next nom
inee who comes up for the Supreme Court that the White House recognizes that in fact it is its duty not just to the Senate but to
 the American people to make sure we can thoroughly and adequately evaluate the record of every single nominee who comes before u
s.Having said that, the decision with respect to Judge Roberts' nomination has not been an easy one for me to make. As some of yo
u know, I have not only argued cases before appellate courts but for 10 years was a member of the University of Chicago Law Schoo
l faculty and taught courses in constitutional law. Part of the culture of the University of Chicago Law School faculty is to mai
ntain a sense of collegiality between those people who hold different views. What engenders respect is not the particular outcome
 that a legal scholar arrives at but, rather, the intellectual rigor and honesty with which he or she arrives at a decision.Given
 that background, I am sorely tempted to vote for Judge Roberts based on my study of his resume, his conduct during the hearings,
 and a conversation I had with him yesterday afternoon.There is absolutely no doubt in my mind Judge Roberts is qualified to sit 
on the highest court in the land. Moreover, he seems to have the comportment and the temperament that makes for a good judge. He 
is humble, he is personally decent, and he appears to be respectful of different points of view. It is absolutely clear to me tha
t Judge Roberts truly loves the law. He couldn't have achieved his excellent record as an advocate before the Supreme Court witho
ut that passion for the law, and it became apparent to me in our conversation that he does, in fact, deeply respect the basic pre
cepts that go into deciding 95 percent of the cases that come before the Federal court -- adherence to precedence, a certain mode
sty in reading statutes and constitutional text, a respect for procedural regularity, and an impartiality in presiding over the a
dversarial system. All of these characteristics make me want to vote for Judge Roberts.The problem I face -- a problem that has b
een voiced by some of my other colleagues, both those who are voting for Mr. Roberts and those who are voting against Mr. Roberts
 -- is that while adherence to legal precedent and rules of statutory or constitutional construction will dispose of 95 percent o
f the cases that come before a court, so that both a Scalia and a Ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of the time on thos
e 95 percent of the cases -- what matters on the Supreme Court is those 5 percent of cases that are truly difficult. In those cas
es, adherence to precedent and rules of construction and interpretation will only get you through the 25th mile of the marathon. 
That last mile can only be determined on the basis of one's deepest values, one's core concerns, one's broader perspectives on ho
w the world works, and the depth and breadth of one's empathy.In those 5 percent of hard cases, the constitutional text will not 
be directly on point. The language of the statute will not be perfectly clear. Legal process alone will not lead you to a rule of
 decision. In those circumstances, your decisions about whether affirmative action is an appropriate response to the history of d
iscrimination in this country or whether a general right of privacy encompasses a more specific right of women to control their r
eproductive decisions or whether the commerce clause empowers Congress to speak on those issues of broad national concern that ma
y be only tangentially related to what is easily defined as interstate commerce, whether a person who is disabled has the right t
o be accommodated so they can work alongside those who are nondisabled -- in those difficult cases, the critical ingredient is su
pplied by what is in the judge's heart.I talked to Judge Roberts about this. Judge Roberts confessed that, unlike maybe professio
nal politicians, it is not easy for him to talk about his values and his deeper feelings. That is not how he is trained. He did s
ay he doesn't like bullies and has always viewed the law as a way of evening out the playing field between the strong and the wea
k.I was impressed with that statement because I view the law in much the same way. The problem I had is that when I examined Judg
e Roberts' record and history of public service, it is my personal estimation that he has far more often used his formidable skil
ls on behalf of the strong in opposition to the weak. In his work in the White House and the Solicitor General's Office, he seeme
d to have consistently sided with those who were dismissive of efforts to eradicate the remnants of racial discrimination in our 
political process. In these same positions, he seemed dismissive of the concerns that it is harder to make it in this world and i
n this economy when you are a woman rather than a man.I want to take Judge Roberts at his word that he doesn't like bullies and h
e sees the law and the Court as a means of evening the playing field between the strong and the weak. But given the gravity of th
e position to which he will undoubtedly ascend and the gravity of the decisions in which he will undoubtedly participate during h
is tenure on the Court, I ultimately have to give more weight to his deeds and the overarching political philosophy that he appea
rs to have shared with those in power than to the assuring words that he provided me in our meeting.The bottom line is this: I wi
ll be voting against John Roberts' nomination. I do so with considerable reticence. I hope that I am wrong. I hope that this reti
cence on my part proves unjustified and that Judge Roberts will show himself to not only be an outstanding legal thinker but also
 someone who upholds the Court's historic role as a check on the majoritarian impulses of the executive branch and the legislativ
e branch. I hope that he will recognize who the weak are and who the strong are in our society. I hope that his jurisprudence is 
one that stands up to the bullies of all ideological stripes.Let me conclude with just one more comment about this confirmation p
rocess. I was deeply disturbed by some statements that were made by largely Democratic advocacy groups when ranking member Senato
r Leahy announced that he would support Judge Roberts. Although the scales have tipped in a different direction for me, I am deep
ly admiring of the work and the thought that Senator Leahy has put into making his decision. The knee-jerk unbending and what I c
onsider to be unfair attacks on Senator Leahy's motives were unjustified. Unfortunately, both parties have fallen victim to this 
kind of pressure.I believe every Senator on the other side of the aisle, if they were honest, would acknowledge that the same uny
ielding, unbending, dogmatic approach to judicial confirmation has in large part been responsible for the kind of poisonous atmos
phere that exists in this Chamber regarding judicial nominations. It is tempting, then, for us on this side of the aisle to go ti
t for tat.But what I would like to see is for all of us to recognize as we move forward to the next nominee that in fact the issu
es that are confronted by the Supreme Court are difficult issues. That is why they get up to the Supreme Court. The issues facing
 the Court are rarely black and white, and all advocacy groups who have a legitimate and profound interest in the decisions that 
are made by the Court should try to make certain that their advocacy reflects that complexity. These groups on the right and left
 should not resort to the sort of broad-brush dogmatic attacks that have hampered the process in the past and constrained each an
d every Senator in this Chamber from making sure that they are voting on the basis of their conscience.Thank you very much. EMILY
'S List Annual Luncheon - Women in Politics TOPIC: Civil Rights May 11, 2006 Remarks of Senator Barack Obama Emily's List Annual 
Luncheon Complete Text Thank you for inviting me here today and thank you to EMILY's List for all you've done to forever change t
he face of women in politics. Your efforts haven't just sent women to Congress, you've sent champions - champions for the right t
o choose, for the right to equality, for the millions of women who ask only that their voices are heard too.And we all owe the bi
ggest thanks to the woman who hasn't just believed in that change, but who's done more to actually affect it, who's helped send m
ore Democratic women to Congress over the last two decades than anyone in politics today. Ellen Malcolm, we are in debt to you, w
e are in awe of you, and we continue to be inspired by your example and your commitment to women everywhere. Thank you.We meet he
re today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history.It's a time where you can go to any town hall or 
street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty abo
ut the direction we're headed as a country. Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people s
ay that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.These are Americans who still believe in an America where a
nything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do. These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense thei
r leaders have forgotten how.I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race. A seat had opened up, and som
e friends asked me if I'd be interested in running. Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced 
with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife.And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the rin
g and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen.I went to bake sales and barber shops and if t
here were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature. And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:First
, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?" Because people just couldn't pronounce it. They'd call me "Alabama
," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya.And the second thi
ng people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man. You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize v
oter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"And I understood th
e question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today. That even though we may get involved out of civi
c obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.So I understand 
the cynicism. But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the Unite
d States Senate.We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago. And in the midst of this rally, someone c
omes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture
 and shake your hand.And so I said fine, and I met her, and we talked. And all of this would have been unremarkable except for th
e fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old.And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and
-five-year-old African-American woman who came all the way to this rally, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.I've thou
ght about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky. That she was born under t
he cloud of Jim Crow, at a time for black folks when lynchings were common, but voting was forbidden.I've thought about how she l
ived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war.I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to 
vote. How she watched FDR lift this nation out of its own fear. How she saw unions rise up and watched immigrants leave distant s
hores in search of an idea known as America.She believed in this idea and she saw all this progress and she had faith that someda
y it would be her turn. And when she finally saw hope break through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe
 it's my turn."And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. And she saw people 
lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it. She kept on voting in each and every e
lection because she believed. She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no chal
lenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America.She believed that we don't have to settl
e for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few.And she knew that during those moments in history whe
re it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused. Who said we're going to
 keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working b
ecause that's who we are. Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.And I th
ink that we face one of those moments today. In a century just five years old, our faith has already been shaken by war and terro
r, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.The world has changed. N
o longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated stu
dent in Bangalore or Beijing. No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their b
ottom-lines know no borders. Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own s
oil.But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still. Our faith has been shaken, but the peopl
e running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding u
s back right now. The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll g
o away. That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods be
ing on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college
 dreams. That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones 
used in Iraq, no one will notice the more than 2,300 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.Well it's time
 we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore.You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this 
at an Emily's List luncheon, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks back. He was talking about what an awful job his ow
n party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over t
he last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:Had enough?I don't know about you, but I think
 old Newt is onto something here. Because I think we've all had enough. Enough of the broken promises. Enough of the failed leade
rship. Enough of the can't-do, won't-do, won't-even-try style of governance.Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told 
that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or 
our chemical plants or our borders.I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that w
e can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.I've had enough of being t
old that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans. I've had enough of that.I've had enough of g
iving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and l
ower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.I've had enough of our kids going to sch
ools where the rats outnumber the computers. I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for t
railers. And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few 
trickles on down to everyone else in this country.You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was ag
ainst nation-building. We just didn't know he was talking about this one.So yes, I've had enough. And if you've had enough too, t
hen we got some work to do. If you've had enough, then we have some checks to write, and some calls to make, and some doors to kn
ock on. And if we do this, then in November, we're gonna have a U.S. House with people like Tammy Duckworth in it, and Melissa Be
an, and Betty Sutton, and Dianne Farrell and Lois Murphy. And we're gonna have a U.S. Senate with Amy Klobuchar and Claire McCask
ill and Maria Cantwell and Debbie Stabenow. And we're gonna change business-as-usual in Washington, and we're gonna set this coun
try in a new direction.Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man. I think he loves his country. I don't 
think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there. The problem isn't that thei
r philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is. It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do.The 
reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem. Tha
t we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go 
buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, 
your own roads, their own levees...It's called the Ownership Society in Washington. But in our past there has been another term f
or it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself. It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may r
ise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair. It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the r
ight parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps. It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or
 thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.It's a 
bracing idea. It's a tempting idea. And it's the easiest thing in the world.But there's just one problem. It doesn't work. It ign
ores our history. Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market. But it ha
s also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility. The idea that everybody has a stake in th
e country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.Americans know this. We know that government c
an't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to. But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own. We kno
w that there are some things we do better together.We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday 
schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper. That we have individual respon
sibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other.That's what America is.And so I am eager to have this argument
 not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.Because I think that this is our mo
ment to lead.The time for our party's identity crisis is over. Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don'
t doubt it yourselves. We know who we are and we know what our legacy is.We're the party of Jefferson who first believed that eve
ry child in America should be educated regardless of wealth and birth and circumstance. That's who we are.We're the party of Roos
evelt who lifted this nation out of its own fear and sent workers to the factories and veterans to college and families to new ho
mes and seniors to a comfortable retirement. That's who we are.We're the party that stood up to fascism and defended freedom acro
ss the globe during World War II.We're the party of civil rights, and workers' rights, and women's rights who believes that that 
every member of the American family deserves a shot at the American Dream. That's who we are.We're the party of new frontiers and
 bold horizons - the party that put man on the moon and fueled the research that unlocked the secrets of the human genome. That's
 who we are.And let me tell you about the party I see in the future.In a globalized economy with bigger risks and greater rewards
 - a world where we are at once more connected and more competitive - let it be said that we are the party of opportunity. The pa
rty that guarantees every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high scho
ol, from college to on-the-job training.Let it be said that we are the party that equips every worker with what they need to succ
eed in a 21st century economy - wage supports and pensions, child care and health care that will stay with them no matter where t
hey work or what they do.Let it be said that we are the party of innovation and discovery - willing to blaze a trail toward energ
y independence or invest in the research that could create whole new industries and save thousands of lives.And in a world where 
evil lurks and terrorists plot, let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that matches the might of our military
 with the power of our diplomacy. And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are the
re and how we will win.If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an Ameri
can agenda. Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans. We're tired of being divided, tired of r
unning into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.Americans every
where are desperate for leadership. They are longing for direction. And they want to believe again.You know, as I was thinking ab
out today's luncheon and all the progress EMILY's List has made over the years, the first thing that came to mind wasn't all the 
politics or the campaigns; it wasn't even all the issues debated or the legislation passed.I thought about my daughters.I thought
 about the world that Sasha and Malia will grow up in, about the chances they'll have and the challenges they'll face. And I thou
ght about my hopes for them - that they'll be able to dream without limit, achieve without constraint, and be free to seek their 
own happiness.And I wondered - if they are lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if they someday have th
e chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will they see? Will they see a country that is freer and kinder, more
 tolerant and more just than the one they grew up in? Will they see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country? Will
 all her of my hopes for my girls be fulfilled?We are here today because we believe that in this country, we have it within our p
ower to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.We are here because we believe that thi
s is our time.Our time to make a mark on history.Our time to write a new chapter in the American story.And then someday, someday,
 if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was 
the time when America renewed its purpose.They can say that this was the time when America found its way.They can say that this w
as the time when America learned to dream again.Thank you. Amendment to Stop No-Bid Contracts for Gulf Coast Recovery and Reconst
ruction TOPIC: Katrina & Gulf Coast Recovery May 2, 2006 His Amendment to Stop No-Bid Contracts for Gulf Coast Recovery and Recon
struction Complete Text Mr. President, after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, millions of Americans opened their hearts, the
ir homes, and their wallets to help the victims in the Gulf Coast. Even before Katrinas winds and rains died down, Americans acro
ss the country called national hotlines and pledged their hard-earned dollars, their time, and their prayers to the relief effort
.But they didnt just pledge ? they also delivered. They delivered to the tune of $3.5 billion dollars. Many of these donations ca
me from working-class families who didnt have much to give, but they gave what they could.Like the American people, President Bus
h made a pledge after the disaster. He pledged that he would provide the Gulf Coast with the federal assistance it needed to get 
back on its feet. With the bill now before us, the total amount of federal funding for hurricane recovery will exceed $100 billio
n, and its safe to say that more money will be needed in the months and years to come.But in order to make good on the Presidents
 pledge, we need to do more. We need to pledge to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. We owe this to the Americans who d
onated their own funds to hurricane relief efforts and who trust us each day with the tax money they send to Washington.Unfortuna
tely, we havent done a very good job so far of delivering on this pledge.Yesterday, Senator Coburn and I came to the floor to det
ail the numerous instances of waste, fraud, and abuse in the use of Katrina funds. We know that FEMA spent nearly $880 million in
 taxpayer money on 25,000 temporary housing trailers stored around the country, including 11,000 that are rusting away in a field
 in Arkansas. There are reports of prime contractors charging upwards of $30 per cubic yard for debris removal ? work that actual
ly costs subcontractors as little as $6 per cubic yard. And, as the Washington Post reported, four large companies are charging a
 1,500% mark-up to cover damaged roofs with plastic tarps. Senator Coburn and I have tried to address these problems by offering 
a sensible package of amendments to ensure fiscal accountability and transparency. We have proposed the appointment of a chief fi
nancial officer to oversee the spending of federal funding. We have proposed limits on the amount of overhead expenses that a con
tractor can charge the federal government. And we have proposed that the details of all large Katrina contracts be posted on the 
Internet.Unfortunately, these amendments are not germane now that cloture has been invoked.That is unfortunate. Its unfortunate b
ecause the interests of the American taxpayer are not being well-served by the U.S. Senate. Even though we will have appropriated
 well over $100 billion by the end of this week for Katrina relief and recovery, we havent put any accountability systems in plac
e to ensure that the money is well-spent.I know Im new to this body, but Im troubled that Senate rules are getting in the way of 
sound policy. I understand thats how the Senate works, so Senator Coburn and I are here to offer one modest amendment to protect 
taxpayer dollars. Our amendment addresses no-bid contracting and is germane to the underlying bill.Immediately after the hurrican
e, FEMA awarded four $100 million no-bid contracts to four large companies. $400 million taxpayer dollars, without full and open 
competition.Acting FEMA Director David Paulison was asked about these contracts when he testified before the Senate Homeland Secu
rity and Governmental Affairs Committee on October 6, 2005. He said the following: "I've been a public servant for a long time, a
nd I've never been a fan of no-bid contracts. Sometimes you have to do them because of the expediency of getting things done. And
 I can assure that you we are going to look at all of those contracts very carefully. All of those no-bid contracts, we are going
 to go back and rebid." Senator Coburn and I expected Director Paulison to stick to his word and rebid these contracts. But a mon
th and a half passed, and the contracts still had not been rebid. So last November, we introduced an amendment to the tax reconci
liation bill expressing the Sense of the Senate that FEMA should immediately rebid these contracts. Our colleagues agreed and pas
sed this amendment by unanimous consent.After our amendment passed, both Senator Coburn and I met with Director Paulison, and aga
in he assured us that these contracts would be rebid.Yet, these contracts still have not been rebid. And to add insult to injury,
 FEMA said in March that the contracts would not be rebid after all. In fact, the contracts actually have been extended, despite 
the fact that GAO found that three of these four firms had wasted millions of dollars in taxpayer funds.The abuse doesnt stop wit
h these four contracts. We learned just two weeks ago that the Army Corps of Engineers missed an opportunity to negotiate a lower
 price on a $40 million contract for portable classrooms in Mississippi. Instead, a no-bid and overpriced contract was awarded to
 an out-of-state firm.Ive often heard it said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and ex
pecting different results. Frankly, what were doing with Katrina funding borders on insanity ? we in Congress just keep trusting 
FEMA to enter into competitive contracts even though theres no evidence that it has any intention of doing so.So the amendment we
re offering today is our effort to say enough is enough. Our amendment requires all federal agencies to follow competitive biddin
g procedures for any Katrina-related contracts exceeding $500,000. This is a common sense amendment. Eight months after Katrina, 
theres no longer any emergency that justifies a no-bid contract that might have been entered into the days after Katrina.The Amer
ican people deserve the benefits of competition on government contracts. Competition is good for American business and its good f
or the government. It helps to ensure high quality and low costs. Thats what the American people have a right to expect, and that
s what our amendment seeks to deliver.Before we spend another dollar in the Gulf Coast, lets make sure that we have some transpar
ency and accountability systems in place to ensure that federal money is helping those people most in need, instead of lining the
 pockets of a contractor.In our rush to get money to the Gulf Coast eight months ago, we didnt do that, and the American taxpayer
s ? and more importantly, the victims of Katrina ? paid a heavy price. Lets not repeat that mistake again.I urge my colleagues to
 support Senator Coburn and me in this effort. Energy Independence and the Safety of Our Planet TOPIC: Oil & Alternative Fuels Ap
ril 3, 2006 Energy Independence and the Safety of Our Planet Complete Text In April of 2005, Elizabeth Kolbert did a series of ar
ticles for The New Yorker about climate change. In one of those articles, she tells a very interesting story about some of the ef
fects we're already seeing from global warming.About fifteen years ago, in the furthest reaches of Alaska, the people of a small,
 thousand-year-old, oceanfront hunting village noticed something odd. The ice that surrounded and protected the village, which is
 only twenty feet above sea level, began to grow slushy and weak. Soon, it began to freeze much later in the fall and melt much e
arlier in the spring.As the ice continued to melt away at an alarming pace during the 1990s, the village began to lose the protec
tion it offered and became more vulnerable to storm surges. In 1997, the town completely lost a hundred-twenty-five-foot-wide str
ip of land at its northern edge. In 2001, a storm with twelve-foot waves destroyed dozens of homes. And finally, in the summer of
 2002, with the storms intensifying, the ice melting, and the land shrinking all around them, the residents of Shishmaref were fo
rced to move their entire town miles inland - abandoning their homes forever.The story of the Village That Disappeared is by no m
eans isolated. And it is by no means over.All across the world, in every kind of environment and region known to man, increasingl
y dangerous weather patterns and devastating storms are abruptly putting an end to the long-running debate over whether or not cl
imate change is real. Not only is it real, it's here, and its effects are giving rise to a frighteningly new global phenomenon: t
he man-made natural disaster.For decades, we've been warned by legions of scientists and mountains of evidence that this was comi
ng - that we couldn't just keep burning fossil fuels and contribute to the changing atmosphere without consequence. And yet, for 
decades, far too many have ignored the warnings, either dismissing the science as a hoax or believing that it was the concern of 
enviros looking to save polar bears and rainforests.But today, we're seeing that climate change is about more than a few unseason
ably mild winters or hot summers. It's about the chain of natural catastrophes and devastating weather patterns that global warmi
ng is beginning to set off around the world - the frequency and intensity of which are breaking records thousands of years old.In
 Washington, issues come and go with the political winds. And they are generally covered through that prism: Who's up and who's d
own? Which party benefits? Which party loses?But in these superficial exchanges, we often lose sight of the real and lasting mean
ing of the decisions we make and those we defer.The issue of climate change is one that we ignore at our own peril. There may sti
ll be disputes about exactly how much we're contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere and how much is naturally occur
ring, but what we can be scientifically certain of is that our continued use of fossil fuels is pushing us to a point of no retur
n. And unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country, we are 
condemning future generations to global catastrophe.Just think about some of the trends we've seen.Since 1980, we've experienced 
nineteen of the twenty hottest years on record - with 2005 being the hottest ever.These high temperatures are drying up already d
ry land, causing unprecedented drought that's ruining crops, devastating farmers and spreading famine to already poor parts of th
e world. Over the last four decades, the percentage of the Earth's surface suffering drought has more than doubled. In the United
 States, the drought we experienced in 2002 was the worst in forty years. And in Africa, more rivers are beginning to dry up, thr
eatening the water supply across the continent.As more land becomes parched, more forests are starting to burn. Across Indonesia,
 throughout Alaska, and in the Western United States, wildfires have raged in recent years like never before. A new record was se
t in 2002, as more than 7 million acres burned from Oregon down to Arizona.And while the situation on the land may look ugly, wha
t's going on in the oceans is even worse. Hurricanes and typhoons thrive in warm water, and as the temperature has risen, so has 
the intensity of these storms. In the last thirty-five years, the percentage of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes has doubled, and the 
wind speed and duration of these storms has jumped 50%. A hurricane showed up in the South Atlantic recently when scientists said
 it could never happen. Last year, Japan set a new record when it suffered its tenth typhoon and the United States set a record f
or the most tornadoes we've ever had. And at one point, Hurricane Wilma was the most powerful storm ever measured.These are all f
rightening situations, but perhaps none more so than what is beginning to occur at the North and South Poles. There, a satellite 
image from space or a trip to the region shows indisputable evidence that the polar ice caps are melting. But it's not just a slo
w, steady thaw that's been occurring over centuries, it's a rapidly accelerating meltdown that may eventually dump enough water i
nto the ocean to annihilate coastal regions across the globe.In 1996, a melting Greenland dumped about 22 cubic miles of water in
to the sea. Today, just ten years later, it's melting twice as fast. In real terms, this means that every single month, Greenland
 is dumping into the ocean an amount of water 54 times greater than the city of Los Angeles uses in an entire year. All in all, G
reenland has enough ice to raise the global sea level 23 feet, making a New Orleans out of nearly every coastal city imaginable.I
ndeed, the Alaskan village of Shishmaref could be just the beginning.And yet, despite all the ominous harbingers of things to com
e, we do not have to stand by helplessly and accept this future. In fact, we can't afford to. Climate change may be unleashing th
e forces of nature, but we can't forget that this has been accelerated by man and can be slowed by man too.By now, the culprit of
 this climate change is a familiar one, as is the solution. Last September, when I gave my first speech on energy, I talked about
 how our dependence on oil is hurting our economy, decimating our auto industry, and costing us millions of jobs. A few months ag
o, I discussed how the oil we import is jeopardizing our national security by keeping us tied to the world's most dangerous and u
nstable regimes. And when it comes to climate change, it's the fossil fuels we insist on burning - particularly oil - that are th
e single greatest cause of global warming and the damaging weather patterns that have been its result.You'd think by now we'd get
 the point on energy dependence. Never has the failure to take on a single challenge so detrimentally affected nearly every aspec
t of our well-being as a nation. And never have the possible solutions had the potential to do so much good for so many generatio
ns to come.Of course, many Americans have gotten this point, and it's true that the call for energy independence is now coming fr
om an amazingly diverse coalition of interests. From farmers and businesses, military leaders and CIA officials, scientists and E
vangelical Christians, auto executives and unions, and politicians of almost every political persuasion, people are realizing tha
t an oil future is not a secure future for this country.And yet, when it comes to finding a way to end our dependence on fossil f
uels, the greatest vacuum in leadership, the biggest failure of imagination, and the most stubborn refusal to admit the need for 
change is coming from the very people who are running the country.By now, the Bush Administration's record on climate change is a
lmost legendary. This is the administration that commissioned government experts and scientists to do a study on global warming, 
only to omit the part from the final report that said it was caused by humans. This is the administration that didn't try to impr
ove the Kyoto Treaty by trying to include oil guzzlers like China and India, but walked away from the entire global effort to ste
m climate change. And just recently, this is the administration that tried to silence a NASA scientist for letting the rest of us
 know that yes, climate change is a pretty big deal.Meanwhile, it's pretty tough to make any real progress on this issue in Congr
ess when the Chairman of the committee in charge of the environment thinks that, in the face of literally thousands of scientists
 and studies that say otherwise, global warming is the "greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people." And you know it's
 bad when the star witness at his global warming hearing is a science fiction writer.Now, after the President's last State of the
 Union, when he told us that America was addicted to oil, there was a brief moment of hope that he'd finally do something on ener
gy.I was among the hopeful. But then I saw the plan.His funding for renewable fuels is at the same level it was the day he took o
ffice. He refuses to call for even a modest increase in fuel-efficiency standards for cars. And his latest budget funds less then
 half of the energy bill he himself signed into law - leaving hundreds of millions of dollars in under-funded energy proposals.Th
is is not a serious effort. Saying that America is addicted to oil without following a real plan for energy independence is like 
admitting alcoholism and then skipping out on the 12-step program. It's not enough to identify the challenge - we have to meet it
.See, there's a reason that some have compared the quest for energy independence to the Manhattan Project or the Apollo moon land
ing. Like those historic efforts, moving away from an oil economy is a major challenge that will require a sustained national com
mitment.During World War II, we had an entire country working around the clock to produce enough planes and tanks to beat the Axi
s powers. In the middle of the Cold War, we built a national highway system so we had a quick way to transport military equipment
 across the country. When we wanted to pull ahead of the Russians into space, we poured millions into a national education initia
tive that graduated thousands of new scientists and engineers.America now finds itself at a similar crossroads. As gas prices kee
p rising, the Middle East grows ever more unstable, and the ice caps continue to melt, we face a now-or-never, once-in-a-generati
on opportunity to set this country on a different course.Such a course is not only possible, it's already being pursued in other 
places around the world. Countries like Japan are creating jobs and slowing oil consumption by churning out and buying millions o
f fuel-efficient cars. Brazil, a nation that once relied on foreign countries to import 80% of its crude oil, will now be entirel
y self-sufficient in a few years thanks to its investment in biofuels.So why can't we do this? Why can't we make energy security 
one of the great American projects of the 21st century?The answer is, with the right leadership, we can. We can do it by partneri
ng with business, not fighting it. We can do it with technology we already have on the shelf. And we can do it by investing in th
e clean, cheap, renewable fuels that American farmers grow right here at home.To deal directly with climate change, something we 
failed to do in the last energy bill, we should use a market-based strategy that gradually reduces harmful emissions in the most 
economical way. John McCain and Joe Lieberman are continuing to build support for legislation based on this approach, and Senator
s Bingaman and Domenici are also pursuing proposals that will cut carbon emissions. Right here in Chicago, the Chicago Climate Ex
change is already running a legally binding greenhouse gas trading system.The idea here is simple: if you're a business that can'
t yet meet the lower cap we'll put on harmful carbon emissions, you can either purchase credits from other companies that have ac
hieved more than their emissions goal, or you can temporarily purchase a permit from the government, the money from which will go
 towards investments in clean energy technology. As Fred Krupp, the president of Environmental Defense has said, "Once you put a 
value on carbon reductions, you make winners out of innovators."Any strategy for reducing carbon emissions must also deal with co
al, which is actually the most abundant source of energy in this country. To keep using this fossil fuel, I believe we need to in
vest in the kind of advanced coal technology that will keep our air cleaner while still keeping our coal mines in business. Over 
the next two decades, power companies are expected to build dozens of new coal-fired power plants, and countries like India and C
hina will build hundreds. If they use obsolete technology, these plants will emit over 60 billion tons of heat-trapping pollution
 into the atmosphere. We need to act now and make the United States a leader in puting in place the standards and incentives that
 will ensure that these plants use available technology to capture carbon dioxide and dispose of it safely underground. But of co
urse, one of the biggest contributors to our climate troubles and our energy dependence is oil, and so any plan for the future mu
st drastically reduce our addiction to this dirty, dangerous, and ultimately finite source of energy.We can do this by focusing o
n two things: the cars we drive and the fuels we use.The President's energy proposal would reduce our oil imports by 4.5 million 
barrels per day by 2025. Not only can we do better than that, we must do better than that if we hope to make a real dent in our o
il dependency. With technology we have on the shelves right now and fuels we can grow right here in America, by 2025 we can reduc
e our oil imports by over 7.5. million barrels per day - an amount greater than all the oil we are expected to import from the en
tire Middle East.For years, we've hesitated to raise fuel economy standards as a nation in part because of a very legitimate conc
ern - the impact it would have on Detroit. The auto industry is right when they argue that transitioning to more hybrid and fuel-
efficient cars would require massive investment at a time when they're struggling under the weight of rising health care costs, s
agging profits, and stiff competition.But it's precisely because of that competition that they don't have a choice. China now has
 a higher fuel economy standard than we do, and Japan's Toyota is doubling production of the popular Prius to sell 100,000 in the
 U.S. this year.There is now no doubt that fuel-efficient cars represent the future of the auto industry. If American car compani
es hope to be a part of that future - if they hope to survive - they must start building more of these cars. This isn't just abou
t energy - this is about the ability to create millions of new jobs and save an entire American industry.But that's not to say we
 should leave the industry to face the transition costs on its own. Yes, we should raise fuel economy standards by 3% a year over
 the next fifteen years, starting in 2008. With the technology they already have, this should be an achievable goal for automaker
s. But we can help them get there.Right now, one of the biggest costs facing auto manufacturers isn't the cars they make, it's th
e health care they provide. Health care costs make up $1,500 of the price of every GM car that's made - more than the cost of ste
el. Retiree health care alone cost the Big 3 automakers nearly $6.7 billion just last year.I believe we should make the auto comp
anies a deal that could solve this problem. It's a piece of legislation I introduced called "Health Care for Hybrids," and it wou
ld allow the federal government to pick up part of the tab for the auto companies' retiree health care costs. In exchange, the au
to companies would then use some of that savings to build and invest in more fuel-efficient cars. It's a win-win proposal for the
 industry - their retirees will be taken care of, they'll save money on health care, and they'll be free to invest in the kind of
 fuel-efficient cars that are the key to their competitive future.But building cars that use less oil is only one side of the equ
ation. The other involves replacing the oil we use with the home-grown biofuels that will finally slow the warming of the planet.
 In fact, one study shows that using cellulosic ethanol fuel instead of oil can reduce harmful emissions by up to 75%.Already, th
ere are hundreds of fueling stations that use a blend of ethanol and gasoline known as E85, and there are millions of cars on the
 road with the flexible-fuel tanks necessary to use this fuel - including my own right here in Illinois.But the challenge we face
 with these biofuels is getting them out of the labs, out of the farms, and onto the wider commercial market.The federal governme
nt can help in a few ways here, and recently, I introduced the American Fuels Act with Senator Dick Lugar to get us started.First
, this legislation would reduce the risk of investing in renewable fuels by providing loan guarantees and venture capital to thos
e entrepreneurs with the best plans to develop and sell biofuels on a commercial market.Second, it would let the private sector k
now that there will always be a market for renewable fuels by creating an alternative diesel standard in this country that would 
blend millions of more gallons of renewable fuels into the petroleum supply each year.Third, it would help make sure that every s
ingle new car in America is a flexible-fuel vehicle within a decade. Currently it costs manufacturers just $100 to add these tank
s to each car. But we can do them one better. If they install flexible-fuel tanks in their cars before the decade's up, we will p
rovide them a $100 tax credit to do it - so there's no excuse for delay. And we'd also give consumers a bargain by offering a 35 
cents tax credit for every gallon of E85 they use.Fourth, this legislation calls for a Director of Energy Security to oversee all
 of our efforts. Like the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the National Intelligence Director, this person would be an advisor to
 the National Security Council and have the full authority to coordinate America's energy policy across all levels of government.
 He or she would approve all major budget decisions and provide a full report to Congress and the country every year detailing th
e progress we're making toward energy independence.Finally, while it's not in the bill, we should also make sure that every singl
e automobile the government purchases is a flexible-fuel vehicle - starting today. When it becomes possible in the coming years, 
we should also make sure that every government car is the type of hybrid that you can plug-in to an outlet and recharge.As the la
st few residents of Shishmaref pack up their homes and leave their tiny seaside village behind, I can't help but think that right
 now, history is testing our generation.Will we let this happen all over the world? Will we stand by while drought and famine, st
orms and floods overtake our planet? Or will we look back at today and say that this was the moment when we took a stand? That th
is was the moment when we began to turn things around?The climate changes we are experiencing are already causing us harm. But in
 the end, it will not be us who deal with its most devastating effects. It will be our children, and our grandchildren.I have two
 daughters, aged three and seven. And I can't help but think that they are the reason I wanted to make a difference in this count
ry in the first place - to give them a better, more hopeful world to raise their children.This is our generation's chance to give
 them that world. It's a chance that will not last much longer, but if we work together and seize this moment, we can change the 
course of this nation forever. I hope we can start today. Thank you. Campus Progress Annual Conference TOPIC: Our Past, Our Futur
e & Vision for America July 12, 2006 Campus Progress Annual Conference Complete Text I want to congratulate all of you at Campus 
Progress for the work you've been doing to build a new generation of progressive leadership in this country. At a time when too m
any in the media have written off your generation as apathetic or uninvolved, you're proving not only that you care very deeply a
bout the future of this country, but that you're willing to do something about it.I could stand up here today and talk about that
 future - about our vision for America - but I know that we share similar views on this and that you're pretty well-versed on the
 issues anyway.So instead I'd like to talk a bit about what comes next for all of you - what happens after you leave the confines
 of college and head out into the real world.It's a scary thought, I know, but I also remember that by the end of my four years i
n college, I may have had a vague idea that I wanted to go into community organizing, but no clue how I would go about doing that
 or whether it was even the right choice for me.I have a feeling that many of you might be in a similar boat when it comes to pol
itics and organizing and activism after college, and so today I'd just like to offer you a few pieces of advice that might be abl
e to help you on your way.The first is to take risks.When I told people that after college, I planned on being a community organi
zer and working in low-income neighborhoods, they thought I was crazy.My mother and grandparents thought I should go to law schoo
l. My friends had applied for jobs on Wall Street. But I went ahead and wrote letters to every organization in the country that I
 could think of. And finally, this small group of churches on the south side of Chicago wrote back and gave me a job organizing n
eighborhoods devastated by steel-plant closings in the early 80s.The churches didn't have much money - so they offered me a grand
 sum of $12,000 a year plus $1,000 to buy a car. And I got ready to move to Chicago - a place I had never been and where I didn't
 know a living soul.Even people who didn't know me were skeptical of my decision. I remember having a conversation with an older 
man I had met before I arrived in Chicago. I told him about my plans, and he looked at me and said, "Let me tell something. You l
ook like a nice clean-cut young man, and you've got a nice voice. So let me give you a piece of advice - forget this community or
ganizing business. You can't change the world, and people won't appreciate you trying. What you should do is go into television b
roadcasting. I'm telling you, you've got a future."I could've taken my mother's advice and I could've taken my grandparents advic
e. I could've taken the path my friends traveled. And objectively speaking, that TV thing might have made some sense.But I knew t
here was something in me that wanted to try for something bigger. And so I went.This is harder than it sounds - and it will be fo
r all of you. With all the work you've done and the organizations you've been involved in, you'll have boundless opportunities wh
en you graduate. And it's very easy to just take that diploma, forget about all this progressive politics stuff, and go chasing a
fter the big house and the large salary and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should buy.Bu
t I hope you don't. Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. And i
t will leave you unfulfilled.So don't let people talk you into doing the safe thing. Listen to what's inside of you and decide wh
at it is that you care about so much that you're willing to risk it all. The next piece of advice comes from a lesson that I lear
ned once I got to Chicago.I had spent weeks organizing our very first community meeting around the issue of gang violence. We inv
ited the police; we made phone calls, went to churches, and passed out flyers.I had been warned of the turf battles and bad polit
ics between certain community leaders, but I ignored them, confident that I knew what I was doing.The night of the meeting we arr
anged rows and rows of chairs in anticipation of the crowd. And we waited. And we waited. And finally, a group of older people wa
lk in to the hall. And they sit down. And this little old lady raises her hand and asks, "Is this where the bingo game is?"Thirte
en people showed up that night. The police never came. And the meeting was a complete disaster.Later, the volunteers I worked wit
h told me they were quitting - that they had been doing this for two years and had nothing to show for it.I was tired too. But at
 that point, I looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street, tossing stones at boarded-up apa
rtment building. And I turned to the volunteers, and I asked them, "Before you quit, I want you to answer one question. What's go
nna happen to those boys? Who will fight for them if not us? Who will give them a fair shot if we leave?"And at that moment, we w
ere all reminded of an important lesson:Persevere.Making your mark on the world is hard. If it were easy, everybody would do it. 
But it's not. It takes patience, it takes commitment, and it comes with plenty of failure along the way. The real test is not whe
ther you avoid this failure, because you won't. it's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn f
rom it; whether you choose to persevere.After my little speech that day, one by one, the volunteers decided not to quit. We went 
back to those neighborhoods, and we kept at it, sustaining ourselves with the small victories. And over time, a community changed
. And so had we.The last piece of advice is to cultivate a sense of empathy.There's a lot of talk in this country about the feder
al deficit. But I think we should talk more about our empathy deficit - the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes; to 
see the world through those who are different from us - the child who's hungry, the laid-off steelworker, the immigrant woman cle
aning your dorm room.The fact that you're here and participating in Campus Progress means that most of you have already done this
 better than most ever will. But as you go on in life, cultivating this quality of empathy will become harder, not easier. There'
s no community service requirement in the real world; no one forcing you to care. You'll be free to live in neighborhoods with pe
ople who are exactly like yourself, and send your kids to the same schools, and narrow your concerns to what's going in your own 
little circle.Not only that - we live in a culture that discourages empathy. A culture that too often tells us our principle goal
 in life is to be rich, thin, young, famous, safe, and entertained. A culture where those in power too often encourage these self
ish impulses.They will tell you that the Americans who sleep in the streets and beg for food got there because they're all lazy o
r weak of spirit. That the inner-city children who are trapped in dilapidated schools can't learn and won't learn and so we shoul
d just give up on them entirely. That the innocent people being slaughtered and expelled from their homes half a world away are s
omebody else's problem to take care of.I hope you don't listen to this. I hope you choose to broaden, and not contract, your ambi
t of concern. Not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate, although you do have that obligation. Not becau
se you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are, although you do have that debt.It's because you have an o
bligation to yourself. Because our individual salvation depends on collective salvation. And because it's only when you hitch you
r wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential - and become full-grown.As I think about all 
of the good each of you has the potential to do in this world, I'm reminded of this image. It's the image of young Americans - te
enagers and college kids not much older than you - from all over the country, watching the Civil Rights Movement unfold before th
em on their television sets. I imagine that they would've seen the marchers and heard the speeches, but they also probably saw th
e dogs and the fire hoses, or the footage of innocent people being beaten within an inch of their lives, or maybe they would've h
eard the news the day those four little girls died when someone threw a bomb into their church.Instinctively, they knew that it w
as safer and smarter to stay at home; to watch the movement from afar. But somewhere in their hearts, they also understood that t
hese people in Georgia and Alabama and Mississippi were their brothers and sisters; that what was happening was wrong; and that t
hey had an obligation to make it right. And so when the buses pulled up for a Freedom Ride down South, they got on. And they rode
. Thousands of them. And they changed the world.We need you to do the same. As Robert F. Kennedy once told a crowd of South Afric
ans no older than you, "The world demands the qualities of youth; not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a
 quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease."Today,
 I want thank each of you for demonstrating these qualities through your service to the people of this nation, and I wish all of 
you a future that is hopeful, dedicated, and ever youthful. Thank you. Obamas Opening Statement - Floor Debate on Ethics Reform T
OPIC: Ethics & Lobbying Reform March 7, 2006 Senator Obama's Opening Statement Floor Debate on Ethics Reform Complete Text Mr. Pr
esident. Over one hundred years ago, at the dawn of the last century, the Industrial Revolution was beginning to take hold of Ame
rica, creating unimaginable wealth in sprawling metropolises all across the country.As factories multiplied and profits grew, the
 winnings of the new economy became more and more concentrated in the hands of a few robber barons, railroad tycoons and oil magn
ates. In the cities, power was maintained by a corrupt system of political machines and ward bosses. And in the state of New York
, there was a young governor who was determined to give government back to the people.In just his first year, he had already begu
n to antagonize the state's political machine by attacking its system of favors and corporate giveaways. He also signed a workers
' compensation bill, and even fired the superintendent of insurance for taking money from the very industry he was supposed to be
 regulating.None of this sat too well with New York's powerful party boss, who finally plotted to get rid of the reform-minded go
vernor by making sure he was nominated for the Vice Presidency that year.What no one could have expected is that soon after the e
lection, when President William McKinley was assassinated, the greatest fears of the corrupt machine bosses and powerbrokers came
 true when that former governor became President of the United States and went on to bust trusts, break up monopolies, and return
 the government to its people.His name, of course, was Theodore Roosevelt. He was a Republican. And throughout his public life, h
e demonstrated a willingness to put party and politics aside in order to battle corruption and give people an open, honest govern
ment that would fight for their interests and uphold their values.Today, we face a similar crisis of corruption. And I believe th
at we need similar leadership from those in power as well.The American people are tired of a Washington that's only open to those
 with the most cash and the right connections. They're tired of a political process where the vote you cast isn't as important as
 the favors you can do. And they're tired of trusting us with their tax dollars when they see them spent on frivolous pet project
s and corporate giveaways.It's not that the games that are played in this town are new or surprising to the public.People are not
 naive to the existence of corruption and they know it has worn the face of both Republicans and Democrats over the years.Moreove
r, the underlying issue of how extensively money influences politics is the original sin of everyone who's ever run for office - 
myself included. In order to get elected, we need to raise vast sums of money by meeting and dealing with people who are dispropo
rtionately wealthy. This is a problem that predates Jack Abramoff.I agree with those on both sides of the aisle who believe that 
we shouldn't let half-measures and partisan posturing on campaign finance reform derail our current efforts on ethics and lobbyin
g, but I also think this is an issue and a conversation we must have in the months to come.Yet, while people know that both parti
es are vulnerable to these problems, I do think it's fair to say that the scandals we've seen under the current White House and C
ongress - both legal and illegal - are far worse than most of us could have imagined.Think about it. In the past several months, 
we've seen the head of the White House procurement office arrested. We've seen some of our most powerful leaders of both the Hous
e and the Senate under federal investigation. We've seen the indictment of Jack Abramoff and his cronies. And of course, last wee
k, we saw a member of Congress sentenced to eight years in prison for bribery.Now, some have dismissed these scandals by saying t
hat "everybody does it." Well, not everybody does it. And people shouldn't lump together those of us who have to raise funds to r
un campaigns but do so in a legal and ethical way with those who invite lobbyists in to write bad legislation. Those aren't equiv
alent, and we're not being partisan by pointing that out.The fact is, since our federal government has been controlled by one pol
itical party, this kind of scandal has become the regular order of business in this town.For years now, some on the other side of
 the aisle have openly bragged about stocking K Street lobbying firms with former staffers to increase their power in Washington,
 a practice that should stop today and never happen again.But what's truly offensive to the American people about all of this goe
s far beyond people like Jack Abramoff. It's bigger than how much time he'll spend in jail or how many members of Congress he'll 
turn in. Bigger than the K Street project and golf junkets to Scotland and lavish gifts for lawmakers.What's truly offensive abou
t these scandals is that they don't just lead to morally offensive conduct on the part of politicians; they lead to morally offen
sive legislation that hurts hardworking Americans.When big oil companies are invited into the White House for secret energy meeti
ngs, it's no wonder they end up with billions in tax breaks while most working people struggle to fill up their gas tanks and hea
t their homes.When a Committee Chairman negotiates a Medicare bill one day and then negotiates for a job with the drug industry t
he next, it's hardly a surprise that that industry gets taxpayer-funded giveaways in the same bill that forbids seniors from barg
aining for better drug prices.When the people running Washington are accountable only to the special interests that fund their ca
mpaigns, it's not shocking that the American people find their tax dollars being spent with reckless abandon.Since George Bush to
ok office, we've seen the number of registered lobbyists in Washington double. In 2004, over $2.1 billion was spent lobbying Cong
ress. That amounts to over $4.8 million per Member of Congress.How much do you think the American people were able to spend on th
eir Senators or Representatives last year? How much money could the folks who can't fill up their gas tanks spend? How much could
 the seniors forced to choose between their medications and their groceries spend?Not $4.8 million. Not even close.This is the bi
gger story here. The American people believe that the well-connected CEOs and hired guns on K Street who've helped write our laws
 have gotten what they paid for. They got all the tax breaks and loopholes and access they could ever want. But outside this city
, the people who can't afford the high-priced lobbyists and don't want to break the law are wondering, "When is it our turn? When
 will someone in Washington stand up for me?"We need to answer that call. Because while only some are to blame for the corruption
 that has plagued this city, all are responsible for fixing it.As you know, I'm from Chicago - a city that hasn't always had the 
cleanest reputation when it comes to politics in this country. But during my first year in the Illinois State Senate, I helped le
ad the fight to pass Illinois' first ethics reform bill in twenty-five years. I hope we can do something like that here.But we ha
ve to pass a serious bill, and it has to go a long way towards correcting some of the most egregious offenses of the last few yea
rs and preventing future offenses as well. This is not a time for window-dressing or putting a band-aid on a problem just to scor
e political points. This is a time for real reform. I think the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which has 41 cosponsor
s, established the right marker for reform, and I commend Senator Harry Reid and his staff for their hard work in putting it toge
ther.Real reform means making sure that Members of Congress and senior Administration officials wait until they leave office befo
re pursuing jobs with industries they're responsible for regulating.Billy Tauzin may say he wasn't negotiating for a job with the
 drug industry at the same time he was negotiating the Medicare bill, but the fact is this: while he was a Member of Congress, he
 was negotiating for lobbying jobs with not one, but two different industries that he was responsible for regulating: the drug in
dustry and the motion picture association. That's wrong, and that shouldn't happen anymore.Real reform means ensuring that a ban 
on lobbying after members of Congress leave office is real and includes the behind the scenes coordination and supervision activi
ties now used to skirt the ban.Real reform means giving the public access to now-secret conference committee meetings and posting
 all bills on the Internet at least a day before they're voted on, so the public can scrutinize what's in them.Real reform means 
passing a bill that eliminates all gifts and meals from lobbyists, not just the expensive ones.And real reform must mean real enf
orcement. Because no matter how many new rules we pass, it will mean very little unless you have a system to enforce them.I comme
nd Senators Lieberman and Collins for their efforts to create such an enforcement mechanism through an independent Office of Publ
ic Integrity. While this proposal doesn't go quite as far as my proposal for an outside ethics fact-finding commission, it's stil
l very good, and I will work with them to try to get it included in this bill.But to truly earn back the people's trust - to show
 them that we're working for them and looking out for their interests - we have to do more than just pass a good bill this week. 
We have to fundamentally change the way we do business around here.That means instead of meeting with lobbyists, it's time to sta
rt meeting with some of the 45 million Americans with no health care.Instead of finding cushy political jobs for unqualified budd
ies, it's time to start finding good-paying jobs for hardworking Americans trying to raise a family.Instead of hitting up the big
 firms on K Street, it's time to start visiting the workers on Main Street who wonder how they'll send their kids to college or w
hether their pension will be around when they retire.All these people have done to earn access and gain influence is cast their b
allot. But in this democracy, it's all anyone should have to do.A century ago, that young, reform-minded governor of New York who
 later became our twenty-sixth President gave us words about our country everyone in this town would do well to listen to today. 
Teddy Roosevelt said that,"No republic can permanently endure when its politics are corrupt and base...we can afford to differ on
 the currency, the tariff, and foreign policy, but we cannot afford to differ on the question of honesty. There is a soul in the 
community, a soul in the nation, just exactly as there is a soul in the individual; and exactly as the individual hopelessly mars
 himself if he lets his conscience be dulled by the constant repetition of unworthy acts, so the nation will hopelessly blunt the
 popular conscience if it permits its public men continually to do acts which the nation in its heart of hearts knows are acts wh
ich cast discredit upon our whole public life."I hope that this week, we in the Senate will take the first step towards strengthe
ning this nation's soul and bringing credit back to our public life.Thank you. AFSCME National Convention - Challenge for Labor T
OPIC: Economy & Labor August 7, 2006 AFSCME National Convention Complete Text Thank you, and welcome to Chicago.We meet here at a
 challenging time for labor and a challenging time for America. All across the country, from nurses in Chicago to correctional of
ficers in Atlanta to sanitation workers in L.A., Americans have been looking to the future with more anxiety than hope. As transf
ormations in technology and communication have ushered in a global economy with new rules and new risks, they've watched their go
vernment do its best to try and shift those risks onto the backs of the American worker. And they wonder how they will ever keep 
up.In coffee shops and town meetings, in VFW halls and right here in this room, the questions are all the same. Will I be able to
 leave my children a better world than I was given? Will I be able to save enough to send them to college or plan for a secure re
tirement? Will my job even be there tomorrow? Who will stand up for me in this new world?In this time of change and uncertainty, 
these questions are expected - but I want you to know today they are by no means unique. Throughout our history, they have been a
sked and then answered by Americans who have stood in your shoes and shared your concerns.In the middle of the last century, on t
he restless streets of Memphis, it was a group of AFSCME sanitation workers who took up this charge. For years they had served th
eir city without complaint, picking up other people's trash for little pay and even less respect. Passers-by would call them "wal
king buzzards," and in the segregated South, most were forced to use separate drinking fountains and bathrooms.But as the civil r
ights movement gained steam and they watched the marches and saw the boycotts and heard about the passage of voting rights, the w
orkers in Memphis decided that they'd had enough, and in 1968, over 1,000 went on strike.Their demands were simple. Recognition o
f their union. The right to bargain. A few cents more an hour.But the opposition was fierce. Their vigils were met with handcuffs
. Their protests turned back with mace. One march was interrupted by police gunfire and tear gas, and when the smoke cleared, 280
 had been arrested, 60 were wounded, and one 16-year old boy lay dead.And still, the city would not give in.Now, the workers coul
d have gone home, or they could've gone back to work, or they could've waited for someone else to help them, but they didn't. The
y kept marching. They drew ministers and high school students and civil rights activists to their cause, and at the beginning of 
the third straight month, Dr. King himself came down to Memphis.At this point, the story of the sanitation workers merges with th
e larger saga of the Civil Rights Movement. On April 3rd, we know that King gave his "I've Been to the Mountaintop" sermon. On Ap
ril 4th, he was shot and killed by James Earl Ray as he stood on the balcony of the Lorraine hotel. And on April 8th, a day befor
e he was buried, his wife Coretta led the sanitation workers on one final march through the city of Memphis - a march that would 
culminate in the union contract that the workers had sought for so long.This is the legacy you inherit today. It's a legacy of co
urage, a legacy of action, a legacy of achieving the greatest triumphs amidst the greatest odds. It's a story as American as any 
- that at the edge of despair, in the shadow of hopelessness, ordinary people make the extraordinary decision that if we stand to
gether, we rise together.What those workers made real in Memphis - and what we have to make real today - is the idea that in this
 country, we value the labor of every American. That we're willing to respect that labor and reward it with a few basic guarantee
s - wages that can raise a family, health care if we get sick, a retirement that's dignified, working conditions that are safe.Th
e struggle to secure these guarantees has always been at the heart of the labor movement - and the opposition has always been pow
erful. But today, we're facing a challenge like none we've seen before.At the very moment that globalization is changing the rule
s of the game on the American worker - making it harder to compete with cheaper, highly-skilled workers all over the world - the 
people running Washington are responding with a philosophy that says government has no role in solving these problems; that the s
ervices you all provide every day are better left to the whims of the private sector.They're telling us we're better off if we di
smantle government - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health
 care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, the
ir own levees...It's called the Ownership Society in Washington. But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darw
inism - every man or women for him or herself.It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they
 can afford - life isn't fair. It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be b
orn in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps. It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the
 factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own.It's a bracing idea. It's a
 tempting idea. And it's the easiest thing in the world.But there's just one problem. It doesn't work. It ignores our history. It
 ignores the fact that it has been government research and investment that made the railways and the internet possible. It has be
en the creation of a massive middle class, through decent wages and benefits and public schools - that has allowed all of us to p
rosper. And it has been the ability of working men and women to join together in unions that has allowed our rising tide to lift 
every boat.Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market. But it has also 
depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility. The idea that everybody has a stake in the count
ry, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.Americans know this. We know that government can't so
lve all our problems - and we don't want it to.But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own. We know that t
here are some things we do better together.We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools 
to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper. That we have individual responsibility
, but we also have collective responsibility to each other.That's what America is. That's what those workers in Memphis fought fo
r. And that's what we fight for today.Some of what we need to do is clear. When you have a Republican Congress that says "no" to 
organizing rights, "no" to overtime pay, "no" to a higher minimum wage, "no" to Social Security, and "no" to Medicaid, it's time 
to say "no" to that Congress and put Democrats in charge come November.But if we really want to lead - if we really hope to convi
nce the country that our vision of government is better than theirs - we're gonna need more than just "no." We're gonna need to t
ell the country what our plan is for the 21st century worker - what we'll do to give every American the chance to get ahead and r
aise their family.I won't stand up here and say that coming up with this strategy will be easy, or pretend to know all the answer
s.But there's a few places we can start.We can start by fixing our schools to make sure every child in America has the education 
and the skills they need to compete. We can start by making sure that college is affordable for every American who wants to go. A
nd by giving unions a real role in creating a real system of lifelong learning so that workers who lose a job really can retrain 
for other high-wage jobs.In this new economy, we can start giving our workers a chance by making sure that no matter where you wo
rk or how many times you switch jobs, you will have health care and a pension you can take with you always.We'll never rise toget
her if we allow medical bills to swallow family budgets or let people retire penniless after a lifetime of hard work, and so we c
an start by demanding that when it comes to commitments made to working men and women on health care and pensions, a promise made
 is a promise kept.And in a world where two-income households are trying to juggle work and family, we can start giving workers a
 chance with policies that give families a chance. When a parent takes parental leave, we shouldn't act like caring for a newborn
 baby is a three-month break - we should let them keep their salary. When parents are working and their children need care, we sh
ould make sure that care is affordable, and that our kids can go to school earlier and longer so they have a safe place to learn 
while their parents are at work. And when a mom or a dad has to leave work to care for a sick child, we should make sure it doesn
't result in a pink slip.Our vision of America is not one where a big government runs our lives; it's one that gives every Americ
an the opportunity to make the most of their lives. It's not one that tells us we're on our own, it's one that realizes that we r
ise or fall together as one people.And yet, we also know that, in the end, neither policy nor politics can replace heart and cour
age in the struggle you now face. Because in the brief history of the American experiment, it has been the ability of ordinary Am
ericans to act on both that has allowed our nation to achieve extraordinary things.Nearly forty years ago, the strike in Memphis 
came to an end.But today, the march goes on.Every year, on April 4th, the sanitation workers of Local 1733 gather again to march 
the route that led them to justice so long ago. Sometimes they walk the whole way, other years a bus comes to carry them the last
 few miles.They march to remember, but they also march because they know our journey isn't complete - they know we have fights le
ft to win; that we have dreams still unfulfilled.A few years back, one of these workers, a man named Malcolm Pryor, told a report
er, "You have to remind people: We are not free yet. As long as I march, Dr. King's soul is still rejoicing that people are still
 trying."And so today I ask you to keep marching.As long as there are those who are jobless, I ask you to keep marching for jobs.
As long as there are those who struggle to raise a family on low wages and few benefits, I ask you to keep marching for opportuni
ty.As long as there are those who can't organize or unionize or bargain for a better life, I ask you to keep marching for solidar
ity.And as long as there are those who try to privatize our government and decimate our social programs and peddle a philosophy o
f trickle-down and on-your-own, I ask you to keep marching for a vision of America where we rise or fall as one nation under God.
My friends, it's time again to march for freedom. Time again to march for hope. Time again to march towards the tomorrow that so 
many have reached for so many times in our past. I know we can get there, and I can't wait to try. Thank you, and good luck. AP A
nnual Luncheon Washington, DC April 14, 2008 Editors note: The week before this speech, Obama was caught in an uncharacteristic m
oment of loose language. Referring to working-class voters in old industrial towns impacted by job losses, the presidential hopef
ul said: "They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment
 or anti-trade sentiment, as a way to explain their frustrations."Good afternoon. I know I kept a lot of you guys busy this weeke
nd with the comments I made last week. Some of you might even be a little bitter about that. As I said yesterday, I regret some o
f the words I chose, partly because the way that these remarks have been interpreted have offended some people and partly because
 they have served as one more distraction from the critical debate that we must have in this election season.I'm a person of deep
 faith, and my religion has sustained me through a lot in my life. I even gave a speech on faith before I ever started running fo
r President where I said that Democrats, "make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives." I als
o represent a state with a large number of hunters and sportsmen, and I understand how important these traditions are to families
 in Illinois and all across America. And, contrary to what my poor word choices may have implied or my opponents have suggested, 
I've never believed that these traditions or people's faith has anything to do with how much money they have.But I will never wal
k away from the larger point that I was trying to make. For the last several decades, people in small towns and cities and rural 
areas all across this country have seen globalization change the rules of the game on them. When I began my career as an organize
r on the South Side of Chicago, I saw what happens when the local steel mill shuts its doors and moves overseas. You don't just l
ose the jobs in the mill, you start losing jobs and businesses throughout the community. The streets are emptier. The schools suf
fer.I saw it during my campaign for the Senate in Illinois when I'd talk to union guys who had worked at the local Maytag plant f
or twenty, thirty years before being laid off at fifty-five years old when it picked up and moved to Mexico; and they had no idea
 what they're going to do without the paycheck or the pension that they counted on. One man didn't even know if he'd be able to a
fford the liver transplant his son needed now that his health care was gone. I've heard these stories almost every day during thi
s campaign, whether it was in Iowa or Ohio or Pennsylvania. And the people I've met have also told me that every year, in every e
lection, politicians come to their towns, and they tell them what they want to hear, and they make big promises, and then they go
 back to Washington when the campaign's over, and nothing changes. There's no plan to address the downside of globalization. We d
on't do anything about the skyrocketing cost of health care or college or those disappearing pensions. Instead of fighting to rep
lace jobs that aren't coming back, Washington ends up fighting over the latest distraction of the week.And after years and years 
and years of this, a lot of people in this country have become cynical about what government can do to improve their lives. They 
are angry and frustrated with their leaders for not listening to them; for not fighting for them; for not always telling them the
 truth. And yes, they are bitter about that. Now, Senator McCain and the Republicans in Washington are already looking ahead to t
he fall and have decided that they plan on using these comments to argue that I'm out of touch with what's going on in the lives 
of working Americans. I don't blame them for this -- that's the nature of our political culture, and if I had to carry the banner
 for eight years of George Bush's failures, I'd be looking for something else to talk about too. But I will say this. If John McC
ain wants to turn this election into a contest about which party is out of touch with the struggles and the hopes of working Amer
ica, that's a debate I'm happy to have. In fact, I think that's a debate we need to have. Because I believe that the real insult 
to the millions of hard-working Americans out there would be a continuation of the economic agenda that has dominated Washington 
for far too long.I may have made a mistake last week in the words that I chose, but the other party has made a much more damaging
 mistake in the failed policies they've chosen and the bankrupt philosophy they've embraced for the last three decades. It's a ph
ilosophy that says there's no role for government in making the global economy work for working Americas; that we have to just si
t back watch those factories close and those jobs disappear; that there's nothing we can do or should do about workers without he
alth care, or children in crumbling schools, or families who are losing their homes, and so we should just hand out a few tax bre
aks and wish everyone the best of luck.Ronald Reagan called this trickle-down economics. George Bush called it the Ownership Soci
ety. But what it really means is that you're on your own. If your premiums or your tuition is rising faster than you can afford, 
you're on your own. If you're that Maytag worker who just lost his pension, tough luck. If you're a child born into poverty, you'
ll just have to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. This philosophy isn't just out-of-touch - it's put our economy out-of-wh
ack. Years of pain on Main Street have finally trickled up to Wall Street and sent us hurtling toward recession, reminding us tha
t we're all connected - that we can't prosper as a nation where a few people are doing well and everyone else is struggling. John
 McCain is an American hero and a worthy opponent, but he's proven time and time again that he just doesn't understand this. It t
ook him three tries in seven days just to figure out that the home foreclosure crisis was an actual problem. He's had a front row
 seat to the last eight years of disastrous policies that have widened the income gap and saddled our children with debt, and now
 he's promising four more years of the very same thing. He's promising to make permanent the Bush tax breaks for the wealthiest f
ew who didn't need them and didn't ask for them - tax breaks that are so irresponsible that John McCain himself once said they of
fended his conscience. He's promising four more years of trade deals that don't have a single safeguard for American workers - th
at don't help American workers compete and win in a global economy. He's promising four more years of an Administration that will
 push for the privatization of Social Security - a plan that would gamble away people's retirement on the stock market; a plan th
at was already rejected by Democrats and Republicans under George Bush. He's promising four more years of policies that won't gua
rantee health insurance for working Americans; that won't bring down the rising cost of college tuition; that won't do a thing fo
r the Americans who are living in those communities where the jobs have left and the factories have shut their doors. And yet, de
spite all this, the other side is still betting that the American people won't notice that John McCain is running for George Bush
's third term. They think that they'll forget about all that's happened in the last eight years; that they'll be tricked into bel
ieving that it's either me or our party is the one that's out of touch with what's going on in their lives. Well I'm making a dif
ferent bet. I'm betting on the American people. The men and women I've met in small towns and big cities across this country see 
this election as a defining moment in our history. They understand what's at stake here because they're living it every day. And 
they are tired of being distracted by fake controversies. They are fed up with politicians trying to divide us for their own poli
tical gain. And I believe they'll see through the tactics that are used every year, in every election, to appeal to our fears, or
 our biases, or our differences - because they've never wanted or needed change as badly as they do now. The people I've met duri
ng this campaign know that government cannot solve all of our problems, and they don't expect it to. They don't want our tax doll
ars wasted on programs that don't work or perks for special interests who don't work for us. They understand that we cannot stop 
every job from going overseas or build a wall around our economy, and they know that we shouldn't.But they believe it's finally t
ime that we make health care affordable and available for every single American; that we bring down costs for workers and for bus
inesses; that we cut premiums, and stop insurance companies from denying people care or coverage who need it most. They believe i
t's time we provided real relief to the victims of this housing crisis; that we help families refinance their mortgage so they ca
n stay in their homes; that we start giving tax relief to the people who actually need it - middle-class families, and seniors, a
nd struggling homeowners.They believe that we can and should make the global economy work for working Americans; that we might no
t be able to stop every job from going overseas, but we certainly can stop giving tax breaks to companies who send them their and
 start giving tax breaks to companies who create good jobs right here in America. We can invest in the types of renewable energy 
that won't just reduce our dependence on oil and save our planet, but create up to five million new jobs that can't be outsourced
. They believe we can train our workers for those new jobs, and keep the most productive workforce the most competitive workforce
 in the world if we fix our public education system by investing in what works and finding out what doesn't; if we invest in earl
y childhood education and finally make college affordable for everyone who wants to go; if we stop talking about how great our te
achers are and start rewarding them for their greatness. They believe that if you work your entire life, you deserve to retire wi
th dignity and respect, which means a pension you can count on, and Social Security that's always there. This is what the people 
I've met believe about the country they love. It doesn't matter if they're Democrats or Republicans; whether they're from the sma
llest towns or the biggest cities; whether they hunt or they don't; whether they go to church, or temple, or mosque, or not. We m
ay come from different places and have different stories, but we share common hopes, and one very American dream. That is the dre
am I am running to help restore in this election. If I get the chance, that is what I'll be talking about from now until November
. That is the choice that I'll offer the American people - four more years of what we had for the last eight, or fundamental chan
ge in Washington.People may be bitter about their leaders and the state of our politics, but beneath that, they are hopeful about
 what's possible in America. That's why they leave their homes on their day off, or their jobs after a long day of work, and trav
el - sometimes for miles, sometimes in the bitter cold - to attend a rally or a town hall meeting held by Senator Clinton, or Sen
ator McCain, or myself. Because they believe that we can change things. Because they believe in that dream. I know something abou
t that dream. I wasn't born into a lot of money. I was raised by a single mother with the help my grandparents, who grew up in sm
all-town Kansas, went to school on the GI Bill, and bought their home through an FHA loan. My mother had to use food stamps at on
e point, but she still made sure that through scholarships, I got a chance to go to some of the best schools around, which helped
 me get into some of the best colleges around, which gave me loans that Michelle and I just finished paying not all that many yea
rs ago.In other words, my story is a quintessentially American story. It's the same story that has made this country a beacon for
 the world-a story of struggle and sacrifice on the part of my forebearers and a story overcoming great odds. I carry that story 
with me each and every day, It's why I wake up every day and do this, and it's why I continue to hold such hope for the future of
 a country where the dreams of its people have always been possible. Thank you. Floor Statement - Employment Verification Amendme
nt TOPIC: Immigration May 23, 2006 Floor Statement by Senator Barack Obama Employment Verification Amendment for the Immigration 
Bill Complete Text Mr. President. I come to the floor today to discuss the bipartisan employment verification system amendment th
at Senators Grassley, Kennedy, Kyl, and I have introduced.One of the central components of immigration reform is enforcement, and
 this bill contains a number of important provisions to beef up border security. But that's not enough. Real enforcement also mea
ns drying up the pool of jobs that encourages illegal immigration. And that can only happen if employers don't hire illegal worke
rs. Unfortunately, our current employer enforcement system does little to nothing to deter illegal immigrants from finding work.O
verall, the number of workplace arrests of illegal immigrants fell from 17,552 in 1997 to 451 in 2002, even as illegal immigratio
n grew during that time. Moreover, between 25% to 40% of all undocumented immigrants are people who have overstayed their visas. 
And the only way to effectively deter overstays is to reduce access to employment.When Congress last passed an immigration bill i
n 1986, we didn't provide a meaningful way for employers to check legal eligibility to work. Currently, employees can prove their
 legal status by showing a variety of documents, and employers are supposed to record their inspection of such documents by filli
ng out an I-9 form for each employee. As a result, the market for fraudulent documents -- fake Social Security cards, driver's li
censes, birth certificates - has exploded.But, with more than 100 million employees in more than 6 million workplaces, and only a
bout 788 Wage and Hour investigators, employer sanctions have become merely a nuisance requirement to maintain records, not a ser
ious risk of penalties. As a result, the number of "intent to fine" notices issued to employers for hiring undocumented workers d
ropped from 417 in 1999 to just three in 2004.Understandably, employers cannot always detect forged documents. And employers who 
reject workers with questionable documents risk an employment discrimination suit.That's why we need a better alternative. We nee
d an electronic verification system that can effectively detect the use of fraudulent documents, significantly reduce the employm
ent of illegal workers, and give employers the confidence that their workforce is legal.When Congress first considered comprehens
ive immigration reform in April, the legislation on the floor addressed this problem by creating a national employment eligibilit
y verification system. Senators Grassley, Kyl, and I all thought that was a good idea in theory, but we had concerns with the des
ign of the system.Senators Grassley and Kyl proposed that the verification system be implemented nationally within 18 months.Sena
tors Kennedy and I proposed that the system be phased in over five years but that it also include additional accuracy and privacy
 standards, as well as strict prohibitions on use of the system to discriminate against workers.For the past few weeks, our staff
s have worked together in a bipartisan effort to negotiate a substitute that took the concerns of both proposals into considerati
on. I'm pleased that we've reached an agreement.Under our compromise amendment, all employers would have to participate 18 months
 after the Department of Homeland Security receives the appropriations needed to fund the system. All new employees hired would h
ave to be run through the system, and a series of privacy and accuracy standards would protect citizens and legal immigrants from
 errors in the system and breaches of private information.And to make sure that employers take the system seriously, we strengthe
n civil penalties for employers who hire unauthorized workers, and we establish criminal penalties for repeat violators.We've wor
ked in a constructive, bipartisan manner to design an employment verification system that is fair to legal workers and tough on i
llegal workers. This is a good amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.Thank you. Northwestern University Commencement 
Address TOPIC: Commencement June 16, 2006 Northwestern University Commencement Address Complete Text Good morning President Biene
n, the Board of Trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, and the Class of 2006. Congratulations on your graduation, and thank
 you for allowing me the honor to be a part of it.A few months ago, I came across an article in your student newspaper by Elaine 
Meyer.Elaine, give me a little wave if you're out there. There she is. Glad to see you made it to graduation.So, Elaine wrote thi
s article entitled, "Challenge us, Senator Obama." I thought this seemed like a fair request, so I kept reading. And I noticed th
at Elaine set out a few expectations for this speech.According to the article, I'm supposed to be inspirational, but not contrive
d. I'm supposed to be hopeful, but not cheesy. I should be political, but not too political. I should be better than John McCain,
 but not so good that I have to spend the day with Jerry Falwell.To further illustrate what she was looking for, Elaine then very
 kindly quoted at length from the commencement address I gave at Knox College in Galesburg last year - which then completely ruin
ed my plan to recycle that speech for this year.Left with no speech and a lot of pressure, I turned to who else but Elaine for he
lp. And what she wrote next is precisely what I'd like to talk you about today. She said,"When people say they don't want to hear
 about politics in a commencement address, they are in part speaking of not wanting to hear about the outside world and its probl
ems. We students have been insulated enough for the past four years that it shouldn't hurt us to be challenged for thirty minutes
, especially on a day that marks our commencement into the 'real' world."That struck me as an important statement. And it called 
to mind a passage from scriptures that some of you may know:Corinthians 13:11: "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as
 a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things."I bring this up because there's an
 assumption in rites of passage like this that growing up is just a function of age; that becoming an adult is an inevitable and 
natural progression.But in fact, I know a whole lot of thirty year olds and forty year olds and fifty year olds who are not yet f
ull-grown. And if you talk to my wife, she'll tell you that there are times when I do not put aside childish things; when I conti
nually struggle to rise above the selfish or the petty or the small.So even today, as a U.S. Senator, I have to remind myself of 
certain lessons from my own youth - lessons about growing up and being true to my values and ideals.The first lesson came during 
my first year in college. Back then I had a tendency, in my mother's words, to act a bit casual about my future. I rebelled, angr
y in the way that many young men in general, and young black man in particular, are angry, thinking that responsibility and hard 
work were old-fashioned conventions that didn't apply to me. I partied a little too much and studied just enough to get by.And on
ce, after a particularly long night of partying, we had spilled a little too much beer, broke a few too many bottles, and trashed
 a little too much of the dorm. And the next day, the mess was so bad that when one of the cleaning ladies saw it, she began to t
ear up. And when a girlfriend of mine heard about this, she said to me, "That woman could've been my grandmother, Barack. She spe
nt her days cleaning up after somebody else's mess."Which drove home for me the first lesson of growing up: The world doesn't jus
t revolve around you. There's a lot of talk in this country about the federal deficit. But I think we should talk more about our 
empathy deficit - the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes; to see the world through those who are different from us 
- the child who's hungry, the laid-off steelworker, the immigrant woman cleaning your dorm room.As you go on in life, cultivating
 this quality of empathy will become harder, not easier. There's no community service requirement in the real world; no one forci
ng you to care. You'll be free to live in neighborhoods with people who are exactly like yourself, and send your kids to the same
 schools, and narrow your concerns to what's going in your own little circle.Not only that - we live in a culture that discourage
s empathy. A culture that too often tells us our principle goal in life is to be rich, thin, young, famous, safe, and entertained
. A culture where those in power too often encourage these selfish impulses.They will tell you that the Americans who sleep in th
e streets and beg for food got there because they're all lazy or weak of spirit. That the inner-city children who are trapped in 
dilapidated schools can't learn and won't learn and so we should just give up on them entirely. That the innocent people being sl
aughtered and expelled from their homes half a world away are somebody else's problem to take care of.I hope you don't listen to 
this. I hope you choose to broaden, and not contract, your ambit of concern. Not because you have an obligation to those who are 
less fortunate, although you do have that obligation. Not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you
 are, although you do have that debt.It's because you have an obligation to yourself. Because our individual salvation depends on
 collective salvation. And because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize yo
ur true potential - and become full-grown.The second lesson I learned after college, when I had this crazy idea that I wanted to 
be a community organizer and work in low-income neighborhoods.My mother and grandparents thought I should go to law school. My fr
iends had applied for jobs on Wall Street. But I went ahead and wrote letters to every organization in the country that I could t
hink of. And finally, this small group of churches on the south side of Chicago wrote back and gave me a job organizing neighborh
oods devastated by steel-plant closings in the early 80s.The churches didn't have much money - so they offered me a grand sum of 
$12,000 a year plus $1,000 to buy a car. And I got ready to move to Chicago - a place I had never been and where I didn't know a 
living soul.Even people who didn't know me were skeptical of my decision. I remember having a conversation with an older man I ha
d met before I arrived in Chicago. I told him about my plans, and he looked at me and said, "Let me tell something. You look like
 a nice clean-cut young man, and you've got a nice voice. So let me give you a piece of advice - forget this community organizing
 business. You can't change the world, and people won't appreciate you trying. What you should do is go into television broadcast
ing. I'm telling you, you've got a future."I could've taken my mother's advice and I could've taken my grandparents advice. I cou
ld've taken the path my friends traveled. And objectively speaking, that TV thing might have made some sense.But I knew there was
 something in me that wanted to try for something bigger.So the second lesson is this: Challenge yourself. Take some risks in you
r life.This may be difficult for all of you because one of the great things about graduating from Northwestern is that you can no
w punch your own ticket. You can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and go chasing after the big house and the large salary 
and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should buy.But I hope you don't. Focusing your life s
olely on making a buck shows a poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. And it will leave you unfulfilled.I often thi
nk about the young Americans - teenagers and college kids not much older than you - from all over the country, watching the Civil
 Rights Movement unfold before them on their television sets.I imagine that they would've seen the marchers and heard the speeche
s, but they also probably saw the dogs and the fire hoses, or the footage of innocent people being beaten within an inch of their
 lives; or heard the news the day those four little girls died when someone threw a bomb into their church.Instinctively, they kn
ew that it was safer and smarter to stay at home; to watch the movement from afar. But they also understood that these people in 
Georgia and Alabama and Mississippi were their brothers and sisters; that what was happening was wrong; and that they had an obli
gation to make it right. When the buses pulled up for a Freedom Ride down South, they got on. They took a risk. And they changed 
the world.So don't let people talk you into doing the safe thing. Listen to what's inside of you and decide what it is that you c
are about so much that you're willing to risk it all.The third lesson is one that I learned once I got to Chicago. I had spent we
eks organizing our very first community meeting around the issue of gang violence. We invited the police; we made phone calls, we
nt to churches, and passed out flyers. I had been warned of the turf battles and bad politics between certain community leaders, 
but I ignored them, confident that I knew what I was doing.The night of the meeting we arranged rows and rows of chairs in antici
pation of the crowd. And we waited. And we waited. And finally, a group of older people walk in to the hall. And they sit down. A
nd this little old lady raises her hand and asks, "Is this where the bingo game is?"Thirteen people showed up that night. The pol
ice never came. And the meeting was a complete disaster. Later, the volunteers I worked with told me they were quitting - that th
ey had been doing this for two years and had nothing to show for it.I was tired too. But at that point, I looked outside and saw 
some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street, tossing stones at boarded-up apartment building. And I turned to the v
olunteers, and I asked them, "Before you quit, I want you to answer one question. What's gonna happen to those boys? Who will fig
ht for them if not us? Who will give them a fair shot if we leave?" And at that moment, we were all reminded of a third lesson in
 growing up: Persevere.Making your mark on the world is hard. If it were easy, everybody would do it. But it's not. It takes pati
ence, it takes commitment, and it comes with plenty of failure along the way. The real test is not whether you avoid this failure
, because you won't. it's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose 
to persevere.After my little speech that day, one by one, the volunteers decided not to quit. We went back to those neighborhoods
, and we kept at it, sustaining ourselves with the small victories. And over time, a community changed. And so had we. Cultivatin
g empathy, challenging yourself, persevering in the face of adversity - these are the qualities that I've found to be important i
n my own life.But what's true for individuals can also be true for nations.For what America needs right now, more than ever, is a
 sense of purpose to guide us through the challenges that lie ahead; a maturity that we seem to have lost somewhere along the way
; a willingness to engage in a sober, adult conversation about our future.When we measure our greatness as a nation by how far th
e stock market rises or falls instead of how many opportunities we've opened up for America's children, we're displaying a prefer
ence for the childish. When we believe that force is the only way to accomplish our ends in the world, when our leaders exaggerat
e or fudge the truth, we haven't set aside childish things. When we run our budget into red ink for things that we want instead o
f things that we need, we're indicating that we're not yet full-grown.For a brief moment, there was the hope that this kind of po
litics would've ended after 9/11. There was a sense of unity born from the rubble of those buildings - young people signing up to
 serve; political leaders of both parties working together; people asking new questions about our world, hungry for the answers.B
ut at some point, we began to drift. Republican and Democrat alike went back to procrastinating about problems that we now have t
o face. We sent young Americans to fight a war without asking anyone back home to sacrifice their time or their tax cut. We argue
 about the inconsequential, and caricature our opponents to score cheap political points. Our media returned to covering the sens
ational and feeding our ever-shortening attention span.And in the meantime, our problems are left to fester.We have a global econ
omy that's forcing us to compete like never before. In today's world a job can now travel anywhere there's an internet connection
 and a worker who's smart and skilled. And if China and India keep educating their kids better and longer than we are, that's whe
re the jobs will go.We can meet this challenge if we fix our schools, if we make college affordable, if we train our workers, if 
we invest more in research and technology. We know what needs to be done. What's lacking is the political will.We have a health c
are crisis in this country that's left 46 million Americans uninsured; that's left millions unable to deal with rising co-payment
s; that's left businesses near bankruptcy.We can meet this challenge if we modernize our health care system, if we improve qualit
y, if we pool our resources to bargain for affordable insurance. What's been lacking is the political will.We have an energy cris
is that's keeping gas prices high; destroying our climate, and forcing us to send billions of dollars to the very countries who w
ant to cause us harm.We can meet this challenge if we harness alternative fuels and build cars that go further on a tank of gas. 
But we need to find the will to make it happen.We need new strategies to fight the war on terror. In a world where terrorists can
 hide and blend into any city on the planet, we can't just believe - as Bill Clinton says - that we can kill or jail every single
 one of our enemies.We can meet this challenge if we realize this isn't just battle of armies but also of ideas; if we rebuild ou
r institutions and strengthen our alliances as Truman and Acheson and Keenan and Marshall did after World War II; if we bring hop
e to those pockets of desperation where a jihad is a better bet than a job.But what's lacking is that political will.Each and eve
ry one of these challenges call for an America that is more purposeful, more grown-up than the America that we have today. An Ame
rica that reflects the lessons that have helped so many of its people mature in their own lives. An America that's about not just
 each of us, but all of us. An America that takes great risks in the face of greater odds. An America that, above all, perseveres
.Over one hundred and fifty classes have sat where you sit today, some in good times, others in bad. Some were years that just ro
lled into the next, and others would mark a turning point in our nation.The class of 1860 would find their country torn apart by 
civil war in less than a year. Many of them would listen to their President tell them that a house divided cannot stand, and they
 would answer the call to save a union and free a people.The class of 1932 would look out a nation in mired in depression; a nati
on ill-fed, ill-clothed, and ill-housed. They would hear a man who could not lift himself from his wheelchair lift a nation by te
lling us that it was only fear itself standing in our way. And they would answer the call to conquer that fear.The class of 1960 
would find themselves at the beginning of a decade where social and racial strife threatened to tear apart the very fabric of the
 nation. They would hear a young President urge them to ask what they could do for their country. And they would answer the call 
to sit at lunch counters and take those Freedom Rides; they would march for justice and live for equality.And now it is 2006. And
 here you sit facing challenges as great as any in the past. And the choice is yours. Will the years pass with barely a whisper f
rom your generation? Or will we look back on this time as the moment where you took a stand and changed the world?Time will tell.
 You will be tested by the challenges of this new century, and at times you will fail. But know that you have it within your powe
r to try. That generations who have come before you faced these same fears and uncertainties in their own time. And that if we're
 willing to shoulder each other's burdens, to take great risks, and to persevere through trial, America will continue on its magn
ificent journey towards that distant horizon, and a better day.Thank you so much to the class of 2006, congratulations on your gr
aduation, and Elaine - I hope I did okay. NATIONAL PRESS CLUB APRIL 2005 TOPIC: Economic Issues April 26th, 2005 National Press C
lub Complete Text Thank you. It's great to be here at the National Press Club - I want to thank the club as well as the FDR Insti
tute for arranging this luncheon together. I'd also like to thank Anne Roosevelt and Jim Roosevelt, who inspire us all by carryin
g on the proud legacy of their grandfather.By the time the Senate Finance Committee holds the first Senate hearing on the Preside
nt's Social Security plan today, we'll have heard just about everything there is to be said about the issue. We've heard about pr
ivatization and benefit cuts, about massive new debt and huge new risks, and we've even been scared into thinking the system will
 go broke when our kids retire, even though we know there'll be enough money then to pay the vast majority of benefits.I'm happy 
to address some of these issues in the Q and A after the speech. But aside from the usual back and forth of this debate, I can't 
help but think about the larger issue at stake here.Think about the America that Franklin Roosevelt saw when he looked out the wi
ndows of the White House from his wheelchair - an America where too many were ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, and insecure. An 
America where more and more Americans were finding themselves on the losing end of a new economy, and where there was nothing ava
ilable to cushion their fall.Some thought that our country didn't have a responsibility to do anything about these problems, that
 people would be better off left to their own devices and the whims of the market. Others believed that American capitalism had f
ailed and that it was time to try something else altogether.But our President believed deeply in the American idea.He understood 
that the freedom to pursue our own individual dreams is made possible by the promise that if fate causes us to stumble or fall, o
ur larger American family will be there to lift us up. That if we're willing to share even a small amount of life's risks and rew
ards with each other, then we'll all have the chance to make the most of our God-given potential.And because Franklin Roosevelt h
ad the courage to act on this idea, individual Americans were able to get back on their feet and build a shared prosperity that i
s still the envy of the world.The New Deal gave the laid-off worker a guarantee that he could count on unemployment insurance to 
put food on his family's table while he looked for a new job. It gave the young man who suffered a debilitating accident assuranc
e that he could count on disability benefits to get him through the tough times. A widow might still raise her children without t
he indignity of charity. And Franklin Roosevelt's greatest legacy promised the couple who put in a lifetime of sacrifice and hard
 work that they could retire in comfort and dignity because of Social Security.Today, we're told by those who want to privatize t
hat promise how much things are different and times have changed since Roosevelt's day.I couldn't agree more.A child born in this
 new century is likely to start his life with both parents - or a single parent - working full-time jobs. They'll try their harde
st to juggle work and family, but they'll end up needing child care to keep him safe, cared for, and educated early.They'll want 
to give him the best education possible, but unless they live in a wealthy town with good public schools, they'll have to settle 
for less or find the money for private schools.This student will study hard and dream of going to the best colleges in the countr
y, but with tuition rising higher and faster than ever before, he may have to postpone those dreams or start life deeper in debt 
than any generation before him.When he graduates from college, this young man will find a job market where middle-class manufactu
ring jobs with good benefits have long been replaced with low-wage, low-benefit service sector jobs and high-skill, high-wage job
s of the future.To get those good jobs, he'll need the skills and knowledge to not only compete with other workers in America, bu
t with highly skilled and highly knowledgeable workers all over the world who are being recruited by the same companies that once
 made their home in this country.When he finally starts his job, he'll want health insurance, but rising costs mean that fewer em
ployers can afford to provide that benefit, and when they do, fewer employees can afford the record premiums.When he starts a fam
ily, he'll want to buy a house and a car and pay for child care and college for his own children, but as he watches the lucky few
 benefit from lucrative bonuses and tax shelters, he'll see his own tax burden rise and his own paycheck barely cover this month'
s bills.And when he retires, he'll hope that he and his wife have saved enough, but if there wasn't enough to save, he'll hope th
at there will still be two Social Security checks that come to the house every month.These are the challenges we face at the begi
nning of the 21st century. We shouldn't exaggerate; we aren't seeing the absolute deprivation of the Great Depression. But it can
not be denied that families face more risk and greater insecurity than we have known since FDR's time, even as those families hav
e fewer resources available to help pull themselves through the tough spots. Whereas people were once able to count on their empl
oyer to provide health care, pensions, and a job that would last a lifetime, today's worker wonders if suffering a heart attack w
ill cause his employer to drop his coverage, worries about how much he can contribute to his own pension fund, and fears the poss
ibility that he might walk into work tomorrow and find his job outsourced.Yet, just as the naysayers in Roosevelt's day told us t
hat there was nothing we could do to help people help themselves, the people in power today are telling us that instead of sharin
g the risks of the new economy, we should shoulder them on our own.In the end, this is what the debate over the future of Social 
Security is truly about.After a lifetime of hard work and contribution to this country, do we tell our seniors that they're on th
eir own, or that we're here for them to provide a basic standard of living? Is the dignity of life in their latter years their pr
oblem, or one we all share?Since this is Washington, you won't hear them answer those questions directly when they talk about Soc
ial Security. Instead, they use the word "reform" when they mean "privatize," and they use "strengthen" when they really mean "di
smantle." They tell us there's a crisis to get us all riled up so we'll sit down and listen to their plan to privatize.But we kno
w what the whole thing's really about.It's not just about cutting guaranteed benefits by up to 50% -- though it certainly does th
at.It's not just about borrowing $5 trillion from countries like China and Japan to finance the plan - after all, we know how fis
cal conservatives hate debt and deficit.And it's not even about the ability private accounts to finance the gap in the system - b
ecause even the privatization advocates admit they don't.What this whole thing is about, and why conservatives have been pushing 
it so hard for so long now, is summed up in one sentence in one White House memo that somehow made its way out of the White House
:"For the first time in six decades, the Social Security battle is one we can win - and in doing so, we can help transform the po
litical and philosophical landscape of the country."And there it is. Since Social Security was first signed into law almost seven
ty years ago, at a time when FDR's opponents were calling it a hoax that would never work and some likened it to communism, there
 has been movement after movement to get rid of the program for purely ideological reasons. Because some still believe that we ca
n't solve the problems we face as one American community; they think this country works better when we're left to face fate by ou
rselves.I understand this view. There's something bracing about the Social Darwinist idea, the idea that there isn't a problem th
at the unfettered free market can't solve. It requires no sacrifice on the part of those of us who have won life's lottery...and 
doesn't consider who our parents were, or the education we received, or the right breaks that came at the right time.But I couldn
't disagree more. If we privatize Social Security, what will we tell retirees whose investments in the stock market went badly? W
e're sorry? Keep working? You're on your own?When people's expected benefits get cut and they have to choose between their grocer
ies and their prescriptions, what will we say then? That's not our problem?When our debt climbs so high that our children face sk
y-high taxes just as they're starting their first job, what will we tell them? Deal with it yourselves?This isn't how America wor
ks. This isn't how we saved millions of seniors from a life of poverty seventy years ago. This isn't how we sent a greatest gener
ation of veterans to college so they could build the greatest middle-class in history. And this isn't how we should face the chal
lenges of this new century either.And yet, this is the direction they're trying to take America on almost every issue. Instead of
 trying to contain the skyrocketing cost of health care and expand access to the uninsured, the idea behind the President's Healt
h Savings Accounts are to leave the system alone and give you a few extra bucks to go find a plan you can afford on your own. You
 deal with double digit inflation by going to the doctor less. Instead of strengthening a pension system that provides defined be
nefits to employees who've worked a lifetime, we'll give you a tax break and hope that you invest well and save well in your own 
little account. And if none of this works - if you couldn't find affordable insurance and suffer an illness that leaves you thous
ands of dollars in debt - then you should no longer count on being able to start over by declaring bankruptcy because they've cha
nged the law to put the burden of debt squarely on your shoulders.Taking responsibility for oneself and showing individual initia
tive are American values we all share. Frankly, they're values we could stand to see more of in a culture where the buck is too o
ften passed to the next guy. They are values we could use more of here in Washington too.But the irony of this all-out assault ag
ainst every existing form of social insurance is that these safety nets are exactly what encourage each of us to be risk-takers a
nd entrepreneurs who are free to pursue our individual ambitions. We get into a car knowing that if someone rear-ends us, they wi
ll have insurance to pay for the repairs. We buy a house knowing that our investment is protected by homeowners insurance. We tak
e a chance on start-ups and small businesses because we know that if they fail, there are protections available to cushion our fa
ll. Corporations across America have limited liability for this very reason. Families should too - and that's why we need social 
insurance. This is how the market works.This is how America works. And if we want it to keep working, we need to develop new ways
 for all of us to share the new risks of a 21st century economy, not destroy what we already have.The genius of Roosevelt was put
ting into practice the idea that America doesn't have to be a place where our individual aspirations are at war with our common g
ood; it's a place where one makes the other possible.I think we will save Social Security from privatization this year. And in do
ing so, we will affirm our belief that we are all connected as one people - ready to share life's risks and rewards for the benef
it of each and the good of all.Let me close by suggesting that Democrats are absolutely united in the need to strengthen Social S
ecurity and make it solvent for future generations. We know that, and we want that. And I believe that both Democrats and Republi
cans can work together to do that. While we're at it, we can begin a debate about the real challenges America faces as the baby b
oomers begin to retire.About getting a handle on the growing cost of health care and prescription drugs. About increasing individ
ual and national savings. About strengthening our pension system for the 21st century.These are important questions that require 
us to work together, not in a manufactured panic about a genuine but solvable problem, but with the spirit of pragmatism and inno
vation that will offer every American the secure retirement they have earned.You know, there are times in the life of this nation
 where we are individual citizens going about our own business, enjoying the freedoms we've been blessed with.And then there are 
times when we are one America, linked by the dignity of each and the destiny of all.The debate over the future of Social Security
 must be one of these times.The people I've met since starting my campaign tell me they don't want a big government that's runnin
g their lives, but they do want an active government that will give them the opportunity to make the most of their lives.Starting
 with the child born today and the senior moving into the twilight of life, together we can provide that opportunity.The day Fran
klin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act of 1935 into law, he began by saying that "Today, a hope of many years' standing is
 in large part fulfilled."It is now time to fulfill our hope for an America where we're in this together - for our seniors, for o
ur children, and for every American in the years and generations yet to come.Thank you. ABRAHAM LINCOLN PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND 
MUSEUM TOPIC: Our Past, Our Future, Our VisionApril 20, 2005 Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum Remarks by Senator B
arack Obama Complete Text Let me congratulate all of those who have helped to make this wonderful vision a reality.But we gather 
here today not to celebrate a building. We gather to celebrate a man.What is it that makes Lincoln such a seminal figure in our s
tory? How is it that this man, born in the backwoods of Kentucky, with little formal education, homely and awkward, a man given t
o depression and wracked with self-doubt, might come to represent so much of who we are as a people, and so much of what we aspir
e to be?Some of it has to do with the trajectory of his life. In his rise from poverty, his self-study and ultimate mastery of la
nguage and of law, in his capacity to overcome personal loss and remain determined in the face of repeated defeat - in all of thi
s we see a fundamental element of the American character, a belief that we can constantly remake ourselves to fit our larger drea
ms.Some of it has to do with the sheer energy of the man, the railsplitter, ax-in-hand, looking out at a frontier of hope and pos
sibility. Lincoln believed deeply in the American spirit of innovation and exploration that accepts no limits to the heights to w
hich our nation might reach.In all of this - the repeated acts of self-creation, the insistence that with sweated brow and callou
sed hands and focused will we can recast the wilderness of the American landscape and the American heart into something better, s
omething finer - in all of this Lincoln embodies our deepest myths. It is a mythology that drives us still.And yet what separates
 Lincoln from the other great men has to do with something else. It's an issue of character that speaks to us, of moral resolve. 
Lincoln was not a perfect man, nor a perfect president. By modern standards, his condemnation of slavery might be considered tent
ative; his Emancipation Proclamation more a military document than a clarion call for justice. He wasn't immune to political cons
iderations; his temperament could be indecisive and morose.And yet despite these imperfections, despite his fallibility...indeed,
 perhaps because of a painful self-awareness of his own failings, etched in every crease of his face and reflected in those haunt
ed eyes...because of this essential humanity of his, when it came time to confront the greatest moral challenge this nation has e
ver faced, Lincoln did not flinch. He did not equivocate or duck or pass the challenge on to future generations. He did not demon
ize the fathers and sons who did battle on the other side, nor seek to diminish the terrible costs of his war. In the midst of sl
avery's dark storm and the complexities of governing a house divided, he kept his moral compass pointed firm and true.It serves u
s then to reflect on whether that element of Lincoln's character, and the American character - that aspect which makes tough choi
ces, and speaks the truth when least convenient, and acts while still admitting doubt - remains with us today. Lincoln once said 
that "character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing."At 
a time when image all too often trumps substance, when our politics all too often feeds rather than bridges division, when the pr
ospects of a poor youth rising out of poverty seem of no consequence to the powerful, and when we evoke our common God to condemn
 those who do not think as we do, rather than to seek God's mercy for our own lack of understanding - at such a time it is helpfu
l to remember this man who was the real thing. Lincoln reminds us that our essential greatness is not the shadow of sophisticatio
n or popularity, or wealth or power or fleeting celebrity. It is the tree that stands in the face of our doubts and fears and big
otries, and insists we can do better.Today we come to celebrate not a building but a man. And as that man called once upon the be
tter angels of our nature, so is he calling still, across the ages, to summon some measure of that character, his character, in e
ach of us, today. Chicago White Sox Senate Floor Statement TOPIC: Domestic Policy Related October 27, 2005 Statement of Sen. Bara
ck Obama Chicago White Sox Senate Floor Statement Complete Text I rise today as a U.S. Senator, as an Illinoisan, and as a proud 
resident of the Southside of Chicago, to congratulate the Chicago White Sox for winning the 2005 World Series. As my fellow South
siders know, it has been a long time coming.Founded in 1900 as the Chicago White Stockings, this year's team reached the World Se
ries for the first time since 1959. Over a century of White Sox fans have cheered for superstars such as Luke Appling, Nellie Fox
, Carlton Fisk, Luis Aparicio, Harold Baines, and of course Big Frank Thomas. But we haven't savored the sweet taste of a World S
eries championship since 1917 - until now.Back then, Woodrow Wilson was President, and the Great War was raging in Europe. The Wh
ite Sox were a bright spot in tough times.The Sox won last night the way they have won all season--by playing aggressively, scrap
ping for every base and every run. When Juan Uribe threw to Paul Konerko for the final out, it was fitting that the ball beat the
 runner by only half a step. The four games against the Astros were decided by a total of six runs. Win by the skin of your teeth
. Win or die trying, that's our motto this year.Jermaine Dye is the World Series MVP, and I congratulate him for that, but I'm su
re he'll be the first to say that everyone on this year's team deserves a part of that award. This is a team with so many great p
layers, but no undisputed leader on the field. I don't claim to be a baseball expert - or particularly unbiased on this matter - 
but this is one of the most selfless, balanced teams I've ever seen. A team of unlikely heroes.Scott Podsednik, who hadn't hit a 
home run all season, stepped up and hit two in the playoffs, including the walk-off winner in Game 2 on Sunday. Willie Harris, wh
o barely played in the playoffs, got a pinch hit to get on base and bring home the only run last night. Geoff Blum, a former Astr
o, who got a pinch hit homer in the 14th inning to give us the margin of victory in Game 3. And the pitching--four complete games
 to close out the American League Championship Series. An 11 and 1 record in the playoffs. 15 scoreless innings to finish the Wor
ld Series.Before the season started, the Sox were a consensus .500 team. Even as we built and maintained the best record in the A
merican League all season, there were many doubters. Towards the end of the season, we hit a rough patch, and the doubters got lo
uder. They said Cleveland had more playoff experience. They said even if we held on to make the playoffs, we would get embarrasse
d in the first round. But during the stretch run, manager Ozzie Guillen and his "kids," as he calls them, were calm and relaxed. 
Even as Cleveland came on strong and our lead in the Central Division dwindled, Ozzie's kids continued to play pranks on each oth
er in the clubhouse, and continued to run hard on the basepaths.Once the playoffs started, there was no looking back. That diffic
ult September was gone in an instant. We silenced the doubters by sweeping the World Champion Boston Red Sox. We silenced the Ang
els during the ALCS in five games. And we swept the Astros in four games.I had the privilege of attending game one of the World S
eries on Saturday, and the fans in and around the park were a cross-section of the city. There were plenty of folks old enough to
 remember the '59 team. Almost everyone remembered the 2000 team that made the playoffs. A few were even alive in 1917. A staffer
 of mine, a Southside Irishman and a Sox fan all his life, mentioned a 92-year-old woman at Saturday's game. She was jumping and 
cheering so much with every hit and every run that my staffer worried for her health!I would like to congratulate the entire Whit
e Sox organization, in particular Jerry Reinsdorf, Kenny Williams, and Ozzie Guillen. We will be celebrating this victory for a l
ong time on the Southside, around the city of Chicago, and around the entire state of Illinois.Later today, Senator Durbin and I 
will be introducing a resolution honoring the White Sox, and we will be asking for its immediate consideration and adoption. Than
k you, and I yield the floor. Final Primary Night Presumptive Democratic Nominee Speech St. Paul, Minnesota June 3, 2008Tonight, 
after fifty-four hard-fought contests, our primary season has finally come to an end.Sixteen months have passed since we first st
ood together on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. Thousands of miles have been traveled. Millions of v
oices have been heard. And because of what you said because you decided that change must come to Washington; because you believed
 that this year must be different than all the rest; because you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears but to your gre
atest hopes and highest aspirations, tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another a journey that
 will bring a new and better day to America. Tonight, I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for Pr
esident of the United States.I want to thank every American who stood with us over the course of this campaign through the good d
ays and the bad; from the snows of Cedar Rapids to the sunshine of Sioux Falls. And tonight I also want to thank the men and woma
n who took this journey with me as fellow candidates for President.At this defining moment for our nation, we should be proud tha
t our party put forth one of the most talented, qualified field of individuals ever to run for this office.
