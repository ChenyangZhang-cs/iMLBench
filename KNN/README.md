## K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a non-parametric al- gorithm used for classification and regression in instance- based learning or lazy learning domain. When KNN is used as a classification, objects are classified by its k nearest neighbors’ categories, and the output of the algorithm is the classification result. KNN can also be used as a regression method, and the result is the value of a particular object, determined by the mean values of its k nearest neighbors. The original KNN code is from [“Rodinia: A benchmark suite for heterogeneous computing,” in IISWC, 2009].
