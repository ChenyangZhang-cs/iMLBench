## 3D Convolution Neural Network (3DCNN)

3D Convolution Neural Network (3DCNN) is the feed-forward step of a fully-connected CNN with 3-dimension input. The neurons of 3DCNN are arranged in three dimensions: width, height, and depth. Since 3DCNN has another dimension compared with 2DCNN, it can be applied in training spatial structured data, e.g., video and medical images. We implement 3DCNN based on [“Polybench: The polyhedral benchmark suite,” URL: http://www.cs.ucla.edu/pouchet/software/polybench, 2012].
