## K-means (KM) 

K-means (KM) is a clustering algorithm that is used to learn features in either (semi-)supervised learning or unsupervised learning. It partitions a number of items into k clusters, which minimizes the mean distance between items and cluster centers. In each iteration, the cluster centers will be repositioned until the centers do not change that much. Our KM code is based on the implementation from [“Rodinia: A benchmark suite for heterogeneous computing,” in IISWC, 2009].
