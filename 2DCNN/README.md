## 2D Convolution Neural Network (2DCNN)

2D Convolution Neural Network (2DCNN) is the feed-forward step of a fully-connected convolution neural network (CNN) with 2-dimension input. CNN is a class of deep neural networks and is used extensively in image and video recognition, image classification, recommender systems, medical image analysis, natural language processing, and financial time series. The original code is from Polybench suite developed by Louis-Noel Poucht. Note that we do not include back propagation of 2DCNN and 3DCNN because of the existing of BP. The original code is from [“Understanding co-running behaviors on integrated CPU/GPU architectures,” TPDS, 2017]
