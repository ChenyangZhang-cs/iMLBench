## Winograd Convolution (Winograd)

Winograd Convolution (Winograd) is an optimized convolution operation for 3×3 kernels. By employing Winograd minimal filtering algorithm, Winograd convolution reduces the multiplication complexity by at least 2.25× compared to the original implementation, which shows great success in accelerating CNNs, such as VGG and ResNet.
