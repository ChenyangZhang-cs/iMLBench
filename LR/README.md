## Linear Regression (LR)

Linear Regression (LR) is a fundamental supervised machine-learning algorithm, which is used to build a linear model to fit the relationship between variables. Since modeling linear relationship has been extensively studied, LR’s results are stable and credible.  LR has been widely applied in prediction, error reduction, and variation explanation.  Our LR code is based on the implementation from [“Rodinia: A benchmark suite for heterogeneous computing,” in IISWC, 2009].
